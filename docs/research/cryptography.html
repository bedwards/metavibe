    <p class="meta">The Post-Quantum Transition Begins | December 2025</p>

    <p>On August 13, 2024, <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/08/nist-releases-first-3-finalized-post-quantum-encryption-standards">NIST released the first three post-quantum cryptography standards</a>—ready for immediate use. On March 11, 2025, they selected <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2025/03/nist-selects-hqc-fifth-algorithm-post-quantum-encryption">HQC as a backup algorithm</a>. Between these announcements, Chrome switched to ML-KEM, Apple announced quantum-resistant iMessage, and Signal became the first major messaging app with post-quantum key exchange. The quantum-safe transition has moved from theory to deployment.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://www.iacr.org/">International Association for Cryptologic Research</a> maintains the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/">Cryptology ePrint Archive</a>, where these algorithms faced years of public scrutiny before standardization. Security through obscurity doesn't work. Only schemes that survive sustained attack from the research community deserve trust.</p>

    <h2>The NIST Standards</h2>

    <p>The August 2024 release <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/news/2024/postquantum-cryptography-fips-approved">finalized three standards</a> after an eight-year process that began with a 2016 call for proposals:</p>

    <h3>FIPS 203: ML-KEM</h3>
    <p><a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/final">ML-KEM (Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism)</a>, based on CRYSTALS-Kyber, is the primary standard for key exchange. Its security relies on the Module Learning with Errors problem, believed to resist both classical and quantum attacks. The standard specifies three parameter sets—ML-KEM-512, ML-KEM-768, and ML-KEM-1024—in order of increasing security and decreasing performance.</p>

    <h3>FIPS 204 and 205: Digital Signatures</h3>
    <p><a href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/blog/2024/08/15/nist-fips-203-204-and-205-finalized-an-important-step-towards-a-quantum-safe-future">FIPS 204 (ML-DSA)</a> provides lattice-based digital signatures. FIPS 205 (SLH-DSA) offers hash-based signatures as a conservative alternative. Together with the earlier SP 800-208 (LMS/XMSS), organizations now have multiple quantum-resistant signature options.</p>

    <h3>HQC: The Backup</h3>
    <p>On March 11, 2025, NIST <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/news/2025/hqc-announced-as-a-4th-round-selection">selected HQC (Hamming Quasi-Cyclic)</a> for standardization as a backup to ML-KEM. "We want a backup standard based on a different math approach than ML-KEM," NIST explained. "It's essential to have a fallback in case ML-KEM proves vulnerable." HQC uses code-based cryptography rather than lattices. The final standard is expected in 2027 after a 90-day comment period.</p>

    <h2>Real-World Deployment</h2>

    <h3>Chrome and the Web</h3>
    <p><a href="https://thehackernews.com/2024/09/google-chrome-switches-to-ml-kem-for.html">Chrome 131</a> (November 2024) switched from experimental Kyber to finalized ML-KEM for post-quantum key exchange. This wasn't a minor update—the two versions are incompatible, requiring a clean transition. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/pq-2025/">Cloudflare reports</a> working with Chrome to test Merkle tree-based post-quantum authentication by end of 2025.</p>

    <h3>Signal: First to Production</h3>
    <p><a href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/blog/2024/05/17/apple-s-new-imessage-signal-and-post-quantum-cryptography">Signal implemented PQXDH</a>, becoming the first large-scale messaging app with post-quantum security in initial key establishment. Signal chats are now secured with post-quantum cryptography.</p>

    <h3>Apple: Going Further</h3>
    <p>Apple's <a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/imessage-pq3">PQ3 protocol for iMessage</a> goes beyond Signal's approach. While Signal uses post-quantum algorithms only during initialization, PQ3 incorporates them into the ongoing ratcheting process, using quantum-resistant algorithms repeatedly throughout the conversation. During WWDC25, Apple announced <a href="https://www.encryptionconsulting.com/microsoft-and-apple-advance-post-quantum-cryptography-support-in-upcoming-os-releases/">iOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, and visionOS 26</a> will support quantum-secure TLS 1.3 key exchange.</p>

    <h3>Cloud Infrastructure</h3>
    <p>AWS provides ML-KEM through <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Presentations/2025/building-post-quantum-cloud-services/images-media/buillding-pw-cloud-services.pdf">AWS-LC</a>, their FIPS-validated cryptographic library. Cryptographic service endpoints support hybrid ML-KEM cipher suites, enabling organizations to migrate while maintaining backward compatibility.</p>

    <h2>Migration Timelines</h2>

    <p>Governments worldwide have set PQC migration deadlines:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>United States</strong>: Full migration by 2035; NSA mandated quantum-resistant algorithms for certain applications as early as 2025</li>
      <li><strong>Australia</strong>: Aggressive 2030 deadline set in 2024</li>
      <li><strong>United Kingdom</strong>: Matched US 2035 timeline in early 2025</li>
      <li><strong>European Union</strong>: 2030-2035 depending on application category</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The urgency comes from "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks—adversaries collecting encrypted traffic today, betting future quantum computers will break current encryption. Data with long-term sensitivity (medical records, classified documents, financial data) is already at risk.</p>

    <h2>Hybrid Cryptography</h2>

    <p><a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/pqc-standards">NIST permits hybrid key exchange</a>—combining ML-KEM with classical algorithms like X25519. This provides defense in depth: if either algorithm is broken, the other still protects the exchange. European authorities particularly recommend hybrid adoption as a practical interim step.</p>

    <p>Hybrid signatures remain more complex. NIST doesn't yet support them officially, though some implementations combine classical and post-quantum signatures for added assurance.</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>Why Cryptography Opens Its Research</h2>

    <p>Cryptography presents a paradox: a field devoted to secrets that publishes openly. The resolution is simple—only algorithms that survive sustained attack deserve trust. Papers appear on ePrint without peer review; the community provides scrutiny. A flawed scheme attracts attacks within days.</p>

    <p>This matters especially now. The algorithms protecting internet traffic for the next decades are being finalized. ML-KEM, HQC, and the signature schemes must be examined by every capable cryptographer. The open process that produced these standards—eight years of public competition, thousands of researcher-hours of analysis—is why we can trust them with our long-term secrets.</p>
