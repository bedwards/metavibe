    <h1>Physics & Mathematics</h1>
    <p class="meta">Where Open Access Began | December 2025</p>

    <p>In August 1991, Paul Ginsparg launched a preprint server for high-energy physics at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He expected a few hundred users. Instead, he created the infrastructure that would transform scientific publishing. That server became <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>, and it established the template that every other open-access repository would follow.</p>

    <p>Physicists had been sharing preprints by mail for decades—arXiv simply digitized an existing culture. Mathematicians followed. Today, posting to arXiv before journal submission is standard practice in these fields. Fields Medal winners announce their work there. Nobel Prize research appears there first. The journal version, when it comes months or years later, is almost an afterthought.</p>

    <h2>The 2025 Quantum Moment</h2>

    <p>The 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics went to John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret, and John M. Martinis for their work on macroscopic quantum mechanical tunnelling and energy quantization. Their research proved that quantum phenomena can occur on macroscopic scales—a foundational result for quantum computing.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, China's Zuchongzhi 3.0 quantum processor reportedly outperformed Google's Sycamore by a factor of one million, according to <a href="https://thequantuminsider.com/2025/12/19/tqis-top-quantum-research-stories-of-2025/">findings published in Physical Review Letters</a>. The quantum computing race continues to accelerate.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04259">MIT Quantum Index Report 2025</a> captures the moment: "quantum technologies are evolving from theoretical concepts into tangible technologies with commercial promise... we stand on the cusp of a second quantum revolution."</p>

    <h2>Where to Find Physics Research</h2>

    <h3>arXiv Categories</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/list/quant-ph/current">quant-ph</a> - Quantum Physics (the largest active category)</li>
      <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/list/gr-qc/current">gr-qc</a> - General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology</li>
      <li><strong>hep-th</strong> - High Energy Physics - Theory</li>
      <li><strong>hep-ex</strong> - High Energy Physics - Experiment</li>
      <li><strong>astro-ph</strong> - Astrophysics</li>
      <li><strong>cond-mat</strong> - Condensed Matter</li>
      <li><strong>math-ph</strong> - Mathematical Physics</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Current Research Frontiers</h2>

    <h3>Quantum Computing in High Energy Physics</h3>
    <p>A recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01597">PhD thesis on arXiv</a> explores quantum algorithms for high-energy physics challenges. The Standard Model leaves key questions unanswered, and quantum computing offers alternatives to classical simulation. The research uses quantum algorithms to evaluate Feynman loop integrals and presents Quantum Chebyshev Probabilistic Models for particle physics distributions.</p>

    <h3>Quantum Cosmology</h3>
    <p>Research in <a href="https://arxiv.org/list/gr-qc/current">gr-qc</a> examines how quantum systems couple to quantum fields in cosmological spacetime. Papers explore "gravitationally prepared states"—quantum field states prepared by gravitational path integrals, interpreted as states of closed universes encoding quantum gravitational effects.</p>

    <h3>The Origin of Constants</h3>
    <p>A provocative paper proposes a quantum-mechanical origin for the natural constants themselves, extending the Wheeler-DeWitt equation to treat fundamental constants not as fixed inputs but as dynamical quantum variables stabilized at the GUT or Planck scale.</p>

    <h2>Why Physics Led the Way</h2>

    <p>Physics pioneered open access for several reasons:</p>

    <p><strong>Pre-existing culture.</strong> Physicists had shared paper preprints for decades. Email lists and FTP servers were the norm before the web existed. arXiv formalized what was already happening.</p>

    <p><strong>Mathematical abstraction.</strong> Physics papers are dense with equations, not data. A PDF contains the complete work. No datasets to host, no code to run—just ideas on paper.</p>

    <p><strong>Competition dynamics.</strong> High-energy physics is intensely competitive. Establishing priority matters. Waiting for journal publication meant risking being scooped. Preprints solved this.</p>

    <p><strong>Ginsparg's vision.</strong> Paul Ginsparg understood that the internet changed everything about distribution economics. What once required printing and mailing now cost almost nothing to share globally. He built the infrastructure to match.</p>

    <p>The result, three decades later, is a field where the most important research appears freely online within days of completion, where students in any country can access the same literature as researchers at CERN, and where the journal system persists mainly as a credentialing mechanism rather than a distribution channel.</p>
