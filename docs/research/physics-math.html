    <h1>Physics & Mathematics</h1>
    <p class="meta">Where Open Access Began | December 2025</p>

    <p>In December 2024, Google's Willow chip performed a computation in under five minutes that would take the fastest supercomputer 10 septillion years. In January 2025, LIGO detected a gravitational wave so clear it confirmed predictions Stephen Hawking made in 1971. In mathematics, researchers solved the geometric Langlands conjecture, Hilbert's sixth problem, and the Kakeya conjecture—all in a single year.</p>

    <p>Physics pioneered open access in 1991 when Paul Ginsparg launched <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a> at Los Alamos. Today, posting to arXiv before journal submission is standard practice. Fields Medal winners announce their work there. Nobel Prize research appears there first. The journal version, when it comes months later, is almost an afterthought.</p>

    <h2>Quantum Error Correction: The Willow Breakthrough</h2>

    <p><a href="https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/">Google's Willow chip</a>, unveiled December 2024, achieved what quantum computing has pursued for nearly 30 years: exponential error suppression. The processor demonstrates that error-corrected qubits get exponentially better as they scale—each increase from a 3x3 to 5x5 to 7x7 lattice of physical qubits suppresses the encoded error rate by a factor of two.</p>

    <p>The technical achievement is remarkable. Willow's <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08449-y">distance-7 surface code</a> with 101 qubits achieved 0.143% error per cycle. Qubit lifetimes (T1) improved from 20 microseconds on the previous Sycamore architecture to 68 microseconds. Google built a dedicated fabrication lab to achieve this precision.</p>

    <p>In 2025, Google announced the <a href="https://blog.google/technology/research/quantum-echoes-willow-verifiable-quantum-advantage/">Quantum Echoes algorithm</a>—the first verifiable quantum advantage on hardware. It computes molecular structures 13,000 times faster than the best classical algorithm on a leading supercomputer, opening paths to real-world applications in materials science and drug discovery.</p>

    <h3>The Quantum Computing Race</h3>

    <p><a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2025-11-12-ibm-delivers-new-quantum-processors,-software,-and-algorithm-breakthroughs-on-path-to-advantage-and-fault-tolerance">IBM unveiled Quantum Nighthawk</a> in November 2025—120 qubits linked with 218 tunable couplers, enabling circuits 30% more complex than previous processors. IBM expects to deliver quantum advantage by end of 2026 and fault-tolerant quantum computing by the end of the decade. They've committed $30 billion to quantum research over five years.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/12/tech/quantum-computing-ibm-microsoft-google">Microsoft introduced Majorana 1</a> in February 2025, designed to scale to a million qubits using topological qubits. Working with Atom Computing, they demonstrated 28 logical qubits encoded onto 112 atoms and entangled 24 logical qubits—the highest number of entangled logical qubits on record.</p>

    <p>In March 2025, <a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/4088709/top-quantum-breakthroughs-of-2025.html">D-Wave claimed</a> the first quantum computational supremacy on a useful real-world problem, solving a magnetic materials simulation faster than leading supercomputers.</p>

    <h2>LIGO: 290 Black Hole Mergers and Counting</h2>

    <p>The fourth observing run (O4) concluded November 18, 2025, after detecting <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20250320">200 gravitational wave events</a>—bringing the total to 290 since the first detection in 2015. The <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20250826">GWTC-4.0 catalog</a> doubles the number of known gravitational wave signals.</p>

    <h3>GW250114: The Clearest Signal Yet</h3>

    <p>On January 14, 2025, LIGO detected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW250114">GW250114</a>—a black hole merger producing the clearest gravitational wave signal ever recorded. With a signal-to-noise ratio of 77-80 (compared to 42 for the previous best), two black holes of 33.6 and 32.2 solar masses merged 1.3 billion light-years away.</p>

    <p>The signal was so clean that researchers could, for the first time, confidently extract two distinct gravitational-wave modes in the ringdown phase—like picking out characteristic tones from a struck bell. This <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/2025/hawking-and-kerr-black-hole-theories-confirmed-by-gravitational-wave">confirmed Stephen Hawking's 1971 prediction</a> that when black holes merge, the total event horizon area cannot shrink. It also verified the Kerr equations Roy Kerr developed in 1963 describing spacetime near a spinning black hole.</p>

    <h3>Mass Gap Objects and New Physics</h3>

    <p>O4 discovered several "mass gap" objects—compact bodies between 2 and 5 solar masses, a range where few black holes or neutron stars have been found. <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20240405">In May 2023</a>, LIGO observed a neutron star colliding with an object 2.5 to 4.5 solar masses—the first gravitational-wave detection of a mass-gap object paired with a neutron star.</p>

    <p>LIGO's sensitivity has more than doubled since O1. The binary neutron star detection range expanded from 250 million to 550 million light-years. <a href="https://observing.docs.ligo.org/plan/">O5 is planned for late 2027</a>, with an intermediate run in 2026.</p>

    <h2>Mathematics: A Historic Year</h2>

    <p><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-year-in-mathematics-20251218/">2025 marked a historic year in mathematics.</a> Researchers solved major open problems that had resisted decades of effort.</p>

    <h3>The Geometric Langlands Conjecture</h3>

    <p>Nine mathematicians produced five papers spanning nearly 1,000 pages to prove the geometric Langlands conjecture—connecting properties of different Riemann surfaces. <a href="https://www.mpg.de/24476145/breakthrough-prize-mathematics-2025">Dennis Gaitsgory received the 2025 Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics</a> ($3 million) for foundational contributions to this program.</p>

    <h3>More Major Proofs</h3>

    <p>Researchers <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-top-10-math-discoveries-of-2025/">solved a major case of Hilbert's sixth problem</a>, proved a sweeping theorem about hyperbolic surfaces, and settled the longstanding three-dimensional Kakeya conjecture. The "moving sofa problem"—formalized 60 years ago—finally received a solution. A 17-year-old named Hannah Cairo solved an important problem in harmonic analysis.</p>

    <h3>AI Meets Mathematics</h3>

    <p>Google DeepMind's <a href="https://deepmind.google/blog/ai-solves-imo-problems-at-silver-medal-level/">AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2</a> solved four of six problems from the 2024 International Mathematical Olympiad, achieving silver medal level. The systems use reinforcement learning for formal mathematical reasoning, suggesting AI may accelerate mathematical discovery.</p>

    <h2>Why Physics Led the Way</h2>

    <p>Physicists had shared paper preprints by mail for decades before the internet. arXiv formalized what was already culture. The competition dynamics reinforced it—establishing priority matters when you might be scooped. Waiting for journal publication was unacceptable.</p>

    <p>Three decades later, the most important research appears freely online within days. Students anywhere access the same literature as researchers at CERN. The journal system persists mainly as a credentialing mechanism. The actual distribution happens on arXiv, where GW250114's analysis and Willow's error correction results appeared long before any journal printed them.</p>
