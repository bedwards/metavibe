    <h1>Robotics</h1>
    <p class="meta">Open Source Machines | December 2025</p>

    <p>Robotics presents unique challenges for open research. Software can be shared instantly; hardware cannot. Yet the field has developed remarkable open-source infrastructure, from the Robot Operating System that runs on thousands of platforms to open hardware designs that anyone can build.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://www.ros.org/">Robot Operating System (ROS)</a> is the backbone of this ecosystem. Kilted Kaiju is the latest ROS 2 short-term release (targeting Ubuntu 24.04 and Windows 10), while Jazzy Jalisco is the current LTS release. Recordings from ROSCon 2025 are now available, documenting the state of the art.</p>

    <h2>2025 Research Highlights</h2>

    <h3>HyperGraph ROS</h3>
    <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05117">HyperGraph ROS</a>, published in March 2025, presents an open-source robot operating system that unifies intra-process, inter-process, and cross-device computation into a computational hypergraph for efficient message passing and parallel execution.</p>

    <p>The system dynamically selects optimal communication mechanisms while maintaining a consistent API. For intra-process messages, it uses Intel-TBB Flow Graph with C++ pointer passing (zero memory copying). Inter-process and cross-device communication seamlessly switches to ZeroMQ. Evaluation in diverse robotic scenarios demonstrates significantly higher transmission and throughput efficiency compared to ROS 2.</p>

    <h3>ARK Framework</h3>
    <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21628">ARK</a>, published in June 2025, is an open-source, Python-first robotics framework designed to address the gap where current robot stacks demand steep learning curves, low-level C/C++ expertise, and fragmented tooling.</p>

    <p>ARK ships with reusable modules for control, SLAM, motion planning, system identification, and visualization, along with native ROS interoperability. It presents a Gym-style environment interface that allows users to collect data, preprocess it, and train policies using state-of-the-art imitation-learning algorithms like ACT and Diffusion Policy.</p>

    <h2>The ROS Ecosystem</h2>

    <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07752">ROS 2</a> was redesigned from the ground up to meet challenges set forth by modern robotic systems. ROS 1 wasn't designed with many necessary production-grade features. ROS 2 addresses real-time requirements, security, and multi-robot coordination that production deployments demand.</p>

    <h3>Key Components</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Navigation</strong> - Path planning and obstacle avoidance</li>
      <li><strong>MoveIt</strong> - Motion planning for manipulation</li>
      <li><strong>Gazebo</strong> - Physics simulation for testing</li>
      <li><strong>RViz</strong> - 3D visualization</li>
      <li><strong>tf2</strong> - Coordinate frame transforms</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Research Frameworks</h2>

    <h3>PyRobot</h3>
    <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08236">PyRobot</a> is an open-source robotics framework for research and benchmarking—a lightweight, high-level interface on top of ROS that provides consistent, hardware-independent mid-level APIs to control different robots. It abstracts away details about low-level controllers and inter-process communication.</p>

    <h3>Open Hardware</h3>
    <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01627">ROMR</a> (ROS-based Open-source Mobile Robot) is a low-cost, modular mobile robot using off-the-shelf components, additive manufacturing, aluminum profiles, and consumer hoverboard motors. Fully compatible with ROS, with a 90kg payload capacity and under $1500 cost.</p>

    <p>Open hardware designs like ROMR lower barriers to robotics research. Labs that couldn't afford commercial platforms can build their own, then share improvements back to the community.</p>

    <h2>Why Robotics Shares</h2>

    <p>Several factors push robotics toward openness:</p>

    <p><strong>Complexity.</strong> No one lab can build everything. Robots need perception, planning, control, simulation, and hardware. Open source lets labs specialize while sharing infrastructure.</p>

    <p><strong>Reproducibility.</strong> Claims about robot performance are hard to verify without access to the same software. Open code enables reproduction.</p>

    <p><strong>Standards.</strong> ROS became a de facto standard precisely because it was open. Proprietary alternatives couldn't achieve the same network effects.</p>

    <p><strong>Industry adoption.</strong> Companies like Amazon, Boston Dynamics, and NVIDIA build on ROS. Open source proved more reliable than proprietary middleware.</p>

    <h2>The Hardware Gap</h2>

    <p>Software sharing is easier than hardware sharing. A robot costs thousands or millions to build; code costs nothing to copy. This creates asymmetry—well-funded labs can test on real robots while others rely on simulation.</p>

    <p>The field addresses this through better simulation (Gazebo, Isaac Sim), open hardware designs (ROMR, Open Manipulator), and cloud robotics that provide remote access to physical platforms. The gap remains, but it's narrowing.</p>

    <p>The result is a field where the fundamental software infrastructure is free, where research papers typically include code, and where a student with a laptop can develop algorithms that later run on million-dollar robots.</p>
