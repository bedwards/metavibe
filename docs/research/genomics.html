    <h1>Genomics & Bioinformatics</h1>
    <p class="meta">Where Open Data Became the Norm | December 2025</p>

    <p>The Human Genome Project established a precedent that still defines biological research: data should be free. When the project released its draft sequence in 2000, it set in motion an expectation that genomic data belongs to everyone. That norm persists. Today, the major preprint servers and databases in biology operate on the assumption that research should be accessible within days of completion, not months or years.</p>

    <p>The biological sciences came late to preprints compared to physics, but they've made up for lost time. <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/">bioRxiv</a> and <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/">medRxiv</a> together receive millions of visitors monthly. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated adoption—when speed mattered for public health, researchers couldn't wait for traditional journals.</p>

    <h2>A New Chapter: openRxiv</h2>

    <p>On March 11, 2025, bioRxiv and medRxiv entered a new era. After operating under Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory since their founding, the platforms <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00762-4">transferred to openRxiv</a>, a newly formed nonprofit dedicated to preprint infrastructure. This organizational independence signals the maturation of preprints from experimental alternative to essential infrastructure.</p>

    <p>Starting December 1, 2025, new papers carry the DOI prefix 10.64898 (openRxiv), replacing the 10.1101 prefix from the CSHL era. The platforms now view approximately 10 million people monthly, processing thousands of submissions with a 2-3 day turnaround—two orders of magnitude faster than traditional journals, at costs two orders of magnitude lower.</p>

    <h2>The Numbers</h2>

    <p>bioRxiv's <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/collection/bioinformatics">bioinformatics collection</a> contains over 38,700 preprints. Genomics has 21,100+. Genetics adds another 14,800+. These aren't obscure papers—roughly two-thirds eventually appear in peer-reviewed journals. The preprint establishes priority and enables immediate community feedback.</p>

    <h2>Where to Find Genomics Research</h2>

    <h3>Preprint Servers</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/">bioRxiv</a> - The primary preprint server for biology, founded 2013</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/">medRxiv</a> - Health sciences preprints, founded 2019</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Data Repositories</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>GenBank</strong> - The NIH genetic sequence database, containing all publicly available nucleotide sequences</li>
      <li><strong>PubMed Central</strong> - Free archive of biomedical and life sciences literature</li>
      <li><strong>NCBI databases</strong> - Comprehensive collection of molecular biology resources</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Quality Without Traditional Peer Review</h2>

    <p>Preprints aren't peer-reviewed in the traditional sense, but they're not unfiltered either. bioRxiv screens for plagiarism, checks that work falls within scope, and applies basic acceptance criteria. The community provides rapid informal review through social media, blog posts, and direct author contact. Errors get caught quickly—often faster than in journal peer review, where months pass before anyone sees the work.</p>

    <p>This model works because the biological sciences community has accepted that preprints are preliminary. Readers understand they're seeing work in progress. The stigma that once attached to "unpublished" work has largely dissolved.</p>

    <h2>Why Biology Went Open</h2>

    <p>Several factors pushed biological research toward openness:</p>

    <p><strong>The Human Genome Project precedent.</strong> When the most ambitious biology project in history committed to immediate data release, it established a norm that proved hard to reverse.</p>

    <p><strong>Data-intensive science.</strong> Modern genomics produces terabytes of sequence data. Sharing data isn't just ethical—it's practical. No single lab can analyze everything it generates.</p>

    <p><strong>Reproducibility concerns.</strong> The replication crisis hit biology hard. Open data and methods help other researchers verify results.</p>

    <p><strong>Public health urgency.</strong> COVID-19 proved that preprints could be essential infrastructure. Research that took months to publish traditionally appeared in days on bioRxiv and medRxiv. Speed saved lives.</p>

    <p>The result is a field where major discoveries appear online within days of completion, where datasets that once took years to access are freely downloadable, and where the gap between research and public knowledge has narrowed dramatically.</p>
