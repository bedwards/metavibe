    <h1>Climate Science</h1>
    <p class="meta">Data Too Important to Lock Away | December 2025</p>

    <p>Climate science operates on a simple premise: the data belongs to everyone. When the stakes involve the entire planet's future, restricting access to research serves no one. The major climate agencies—NASA, NOAA, ESA—publish their data openly. The IPCC synthesizes findings into reports freely available to anyone with internet access. Climate models run on open-source code that anyone can inspect and critique.</p>

    <p>This openness emerged from the science's global nature. Climate doesn't respect borders. A temperature record from Antarctica matters to researchers in Norway. Satellite data collected by ESA informs models run at NOAA. The only way to build consensus across nations was to build it on shared, verifiable data.</p>

    <h2>Where to Find Climate Data</h2>

    <h3>NASA Resources</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/">NASA GISS Data</a> - GISTEMP Surface Temperature, Model E Simulations, and various data products</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/services/data-collections">NASA Center for Climate Simulation</a> - Reanalysis data, CMIP archives, and cross-disciplinary science platforms</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/news/earth-science-data-roundup-may-2025">NASA Earthdata</a> - Earth science data access and discovery</li>
      <li><a href="https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/evidence/">NASA Climate Evidence</a> - Synthesis of climate change evidence</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>NOAA Resources</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.noaa.gov/climate">NOAA Climate</a> - Climate products and research</li>
      <li><a href="https://psl.noaa.gov/ipcc/">NOAA Physical Sciences Laboratory</a> - CMIP5 and CMIP6 data archives</li>
      <li><a href="https://csl.noaa.gov/assessments/">NOAA Chemical Sciences Laboratory Assessments</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>International Resources</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://climate.esa.int/en/data/">ESA Climate Change Initiative</a> - Satellite-derived climate data records from 40+ years of archives</li>
      <li><strong>IPCC Reports</strong> - Comprehensive assessments of climate science, freely available</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The IPCC Framework</h2>

    <p>Since its inception in 1988, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has provided assessments informing policymakers worldwide. The latest report, AR6 released in 2021, provides a comprehensive assessment of the physical science basis of climate change. As the IPCC states: "Since systematic scientific assessments began in the 1970s, the influence of human activity on the warming of the climate system has evolved from theory to established fact."</p>

    <p>IPCC reports are remarkable documents—thousands of pages synthesizing research from across the globe, written by hundreds of scientists, reviewed by thousands more, and made freely available to anyone. No paywall. No subscription. The most comprehensive synthesis of climate knowledge, accessible to all.</p>

    <h2>2025 Updates</h2>

    <p>The data infrastructure continues to evolve. In May 2025, NASA's Atmospheric Science Data Center released Edition 1C of the NOAA-20 Level 3 data from the CERES Science Team, containing gridded data of reflected shortwave, emitted longwave, and top-of-atmosphere fluxes, along with cloud and aerosol properties.</p>

    <p>The ESA Climate Change Initiative, established in 2008, leverages satellite archives from ESA, NASA, NOAA, JAXA, and EUMETSAT—international collaboration enabled by data sharing. These records provide crucial inputs to IPCC assessments.</p>

    <p>NASA's Center for Climate Simulation now provides platforms large enough to download, process, and share data in one location. Researchers can access and share results with colleagues, the greater scientific community, and the public—all from a single infrastructure.</p>

    <h2>Open Models</h2>

    <p>Climate models themselves are increasingly open. The source code for major Earth system models can be inspected, criticized, and improved by anyone. This transparency serves multiple purposes: it enables verification, allows researchers without supercomputer access to understand the models, and builds trust in projections that inform trillion-dollar policy decisions.</p>

    <p>NCEP's Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) provides a 31-year reanalysis of the coupled atmosphere, ocean, sea ice and land systems. This isn't just data—it's a complete reconstruction of Earth's climate state, available for anyone to analyze.</p>

    <h2>Why Climate Science Must Be Open</h2>

    <p>Several factors push climate science toward openness:</p>

    <p><strong>Public funding.</strong> Most climate research is government-funded. Taxpayers paid for it; taxpayers can access it.</p>

    <p><strong>Policy relevance.</strong> Climate data informs decisions affecting billions of people. Hiding it behind paywalls would undermine public trust and democratic deliberation.</p>

    <p><strong>Verification needs.</strong> Climate science faces organized denial. Open data and methods allow anyone to check the work—and confirms that the science holds up to scrutiny.</p>

    <p><strong>Global scope.</strong> No country can study climate alone. International collaboration requires international data sharing. Open access is the only model that works.</p>

    <p>The result is perhaps the most openly accessible body of science affecting public policy. Anyone can download the same temperature records that inform IPCC reports. Anyone can run simplified versions of climate models. The science is as transparent as science gets.</p>
