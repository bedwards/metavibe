    <h1>AI/ML Research</h1>
    <p class="meta">The Fastest-Moving Field in Science | December 2025</p>

    <p>No field publishes more openly or more rapidly than artificial intelligence and machine learning. The 18-month journal cycle that governs traditional science is irrelevant here. Papers appear on arXiv within days of completion. Major conferences review thousands of submissions through OpenReview, where the entire process unfolds in public view. The major labs—Anthropic, DeepMind, OpenAI, Meta AI—publish their research directly, often alongside code and datasets.</p>

    <p>This open culture emerged from necessity. The field moves too fast for traditional gatekeeping. A technique published in January may be obsolete by June. Researchers who waited for journal acceptance would find themselves citing outdated work. So the community built its own infrastructure: preprint servers, open review platforms, and direct publication channels that bypass the legacy system entirely.</p>

    <h2>Where to Find the Research</h2>

    <h3>arXiv</h3>
    <p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/list/cs.AI/recent">cs.AI</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/list/cs.LG/current">cs.LG</a> (machine learning) sections of arXiv receive hundreds of submissions daily. As of December 2025, the cs.AI section alone contains over 2,400 active entries. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CL/recent">cs.CL</a> section covers computational linguistics and natural language processing—the home of large language model research.</p>

    <p>Tools like <a href="https://www.alphaxiv.org/">alphaXiv</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/papers/trending">Hugging Face Papers</a> help surface trending work. <a href="https://www.paperdigest.org/2025/03/most-influential-arxiv-artificial-intelligence-papers-2025-03-version/">Paper Digest</a> tracks citation influence across the corpus.</p>

    <h3>OpenReview</h3>
    <p><a href="https://openreview.net/">OpenReview</a> hosts the submission and review process for the major ML conferences. The <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=ICML.cc/2025/Conference">ICML 2025</a> and <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference">NeurIPS 2025</a> portals contain thousands of papers with their complete review histories. This transparency is radical by academic standards—every reviewer comment, every author response, visible to anyone.</p>

    <h3>Lab Publications</h3>
    <p>The major labs maintain their own research portals:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research">Anthropic Research</a> and the <a href="https://alignment.anthropic.com/">Alignment Science Blog</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://deepmind.google/research/publications/">Google DeepMind Publications</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://openai.com/research/index/">OpenAI Research</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://ai.google/research/">Google AI Research</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Current Research Directions (2025)</h2>

    <h3>Reasoning Models</h3>
    <p>The dominant trend in late 2025 is reasoning-focused models. Research subdivides into training methods (reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards), inference-time scaling (thinking longer to solve harder problems), and evaluation frameworks for measuring genuine reasoning versus pattern matching.</p>

    <h3>Agentic AI</h3>
    <p>The field is rapidly rebranding from "Generative AI" to "Agentic AI"—systems that take actions rather than just generate text. Research like "Small Language Models are the Future of Agentic AI" argues that sub-10B parameter models are sufficient for most agent subtasks, which tend to be repetitive, well-defined, and non-conversational. The full capabilities of massive models are overkill for executing tool calls or parsing structured data.</p>

    <h3>Interpretability</h3>
    <p>Anthropic's circuit tracing work allows researchers to track decision-making processes inside large language models step by step. They've mapped how Claude 3.5 Haiku processes various tasks, revealing connections between individual components. This builds on earlier work from DeepMind and others.</p>

    <p>A July 2025 paper co-authored by 40 researchers from OpenAI, DeepMind, Meta, and Anthropic—endorsed by Ilya Sutskever and Geoffrey Hinton—warned that "chain-of-thought" reasoning processes may be the last window into how these systems make decisions. As models grow more capable, our ability to understand them may shrink.</p>

    <h3>Self-Supervised Vision</h3>
    <p>While language processing has converged on universal foundation models, computer vision is still climbing that ladder. Models like DINOv3 represent the push toward self-supervised image models that can serve as the foundation for vision tasks, analogous to what GPT achieved for language.</p>

    <h2>Major Conferences</h2>

    <p><a href="https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForPapers">NeurIPS 2025</a> awarded seven best paper recognitions covering diffusion model theory, self-supervised reinforcement learning, attention mechanisms, reasoning capabilities, online learning theory, neural scaling laws, and benchmarking methodologies.</p>

    <p><a href="https://icml.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForPapers">ICML 2025</a> takes place in Vancouver, July 13-19, covering general machine learning, deep learning, evaluation, theory, systems, optimization, probabilistic methods, reinforcement learning, and trustworthy ML. Papers submitted through OpenReview undergo double-blind review.</p>

    <p><a href="https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForPapers">ICLR 2025</a> focuses on representation learning—how systems learn useful features from raw data.</p>

    <h2>Why It's Open</h2>

    <p>Several forces push AI research toward openness:</p>

    <p><strong>Speed.</strong> The field moves too fast for slow publication. Waiting for peer review means being scooped. Preprints establish priority.</p>

    <p><strong>Reproducibility.</strong> ML research depends on code and compute. Papers without implementations are increasingly seen as incomplete. Sharing code and datasets is becoming the norm.</p>

    <p><strong>Competition.</strong> Labs compete for talent by demonstrating research quality. Published work attracts researchers. Open publication is a recruiting tool.</p>

    <p><strong>Norm-setting.</strong> Early leaders in the field—LeCun, Hinton, Bengio—established open culture before it was commercially significant. Those norms persist even as the stakes have grown.</p>

    <p>The result is a field where cutting-edge research is available to anyone with an internet connection. A graduate student in Lagos has the same access to GPT-4's technical report as a researcher at Stanford. This democratization of knowledge is unusual in science and may not last—but for now, AI research remains remarkably open.</p>
