3. Emotional quotas are law. He's three happiness units short for the quarter. The audit is in an hour. Smiling without documentation is fraud.

4. He's had gills since birth. The surface world is a myth. His apartment is on the 40th depth. The pressure outside would kill a mammal. He remembers breathing air.

5. Currency is time. Literally. He just paid rent and lost eight months of lifespan. The timestamp on his wrist reads 2 years, 3 months remaining.

6. Job interview for a position he doesn't understand, in a field that didn't exist yesterday. The interviewer asks about his experience with "grief architecture." He nods.

7. His spouse died in the war. Everyone knows which war. He has no idea. The condolences have become suspicious. His dry eyes are noted.

8. Words are crude, used only with children. Adults communicate through pheromone secretions. He cannot smell what he's saying. His scent is apparently obscene.

9. A teenager calls him Dad. Shows him a photo from last summer. He remembers nothing. The teenager's face expects recognition. Dinner is getting cold.

10. The elderly are infants, revered and protected. The young are ancient, exhausted, near death. He's middle-aged both ways and belongs nowhere. The census doesn't have a box for him.

11. Everyone can read minds but doing so without permission is assault. He can't stop broadcasting. His thoughts are obscene graffiti on every wall.

12. He's been promoted to a position requiring skills in "temporal arbitrage." Congratulations are everywhere. Expectations are specific. He reports Monday.

17. Manipulating local gravity is the dominant art form. He's a renowned gravity sculptor with an exhibition opening tonight. He doesn't know how to hold a gravity chisel.

18. Different spouse. Different war. Same condolences. Same suspicion at his dry eyes. The pattern is becoming visible to others.

19. He is a serf of Amazon. Not an employee. Property. He needs his lord's permission to change apartments. The form requires seventeen signatures.

20. Words have physical weight. Speaking creates objects. Silence is expensive minimalism. He talks too much. His apartment is cluttered with syllables he can't discard.

21. Everyone knows about the affair except him. The knowing glances. The whispered sympathy for his spouse. Who is he sleeping with? When?

22. Reading is a dead skill, like Latin. Information is absorbed through direct neural feed. He's functionally illiterate in both directions. The world is unreadable.

26. It's his job to grieve at funerals for people he never met. He's good at it. Apparently. The families thank him with unsettling sincerity. The tears come easily now.

27. Everyone sleeps in communal halls. Private sleeping is deviant. He's caught napping alone. The social worker asks about his childhood.

28. He owns a patent worth billions for something he doesn't understand. Three corporations are trying to kill him. Legally, but also the other way.

29. His spouse is a symbiotic organism living in his chest cavity. He can feel it moving. It's been there since the wedding. The wedding he doesn't remember. It loves him.

30. All statements must contain precisely one falsehood. Pure truth is dangerous radicalism. He keeps accidentally telling the truth. The police are interested.

31. He's training someone in a craft he doesn't know. The apprentice is eager. The final exam is next week. The apprentice is better than him already.

32. Men are property. He's male. His owner is kind but ownership is ownership. She decides when he eats.

33. Political power derives from musical ability. He's a senator. His instrument is the theremin. He's never seen a theremin. Session begins at noon.

34. Everyone treats him like he's dying. The doctors speak in soft voices. He feels fine. The test results are sealed. The sympathy is crushing.

35. Every breath is taxed. He's in respiratory arrears. Breathing is a luxury he cannot afford. The collectors are patient.

36. He was famous. Very famous. For something. The fame has curdled into notoriety. People recognize him with complicated expressions. He smiles back uncertainly.

37. The dominant species is a collective intelligence of insects. Humans are tolerated pets. He has a good owner who lets him eat at the table. He's grateful.

38. He took a sacred vow. Breaking it means death. He doesn't know what the vow was. He may have already broken it. The priests are watching.

39. Personal weather is a status symbol. He cannot afford climate. He walks in his own small raincloud of poverty. Umbrellas are for the rich.

40. He has fourteen identical siblings. The original died. No one knows which one they are. Possibly none of them. The inheritance is disputed.

41. Dreams are currency. He's an accountant specializing in dream taxation. A client's nightmare portfolio doesn't add up. Someone has been embezzling terror.

42. His best friend won't speak to him. Everyone knows what he did. The friend's pain is visible. The crime is invisible. He apologizes for something.

43. His body is 90% prosthetic. Original parts are status symbols. He's mostly original. This makes him poor. His authentic liver is worth more than his house.

44. The official language changed last month. Again. He's still thinking in the previous one. This is politically suspect. Re-education is available.

45. Water is sacred. He just spilled some. The room has gone quiet. The floor is drinking his future.

46. A relative he doesn't remember died and left him an obligation he doesn't understand. The lawyers are waiting. The documents are in a script he cannot read.

47. Money doesn't exist. Social credit is everything. His score is visible above his head. It's low. It keeps dropping. He doesn't know why.

48. He designed the prison he's now incarcerated in. The guards keep asking why he included certain features. He doesn't know. The features are concerning.

50. He's in a classroom. The exam is today. The subject is "Applied Metaphysics." His notes are in a language he can't read. Everyone else is writing.
