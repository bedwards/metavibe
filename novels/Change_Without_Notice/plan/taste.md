# Taste: Change Without Notice

## Memory as Burden

The protagonist remembers everything. Every page adds weight. By page fifty, they carry the phantom limbs of forty-nine marriages, careers, bodies, belief systems. They remember being fluent in languages that no longer exist in the current reality. They mourn children who were never born here. They possess expertise in technologies that won't be invented for centuries, or that were outlawed generations ago.

This is not a gift. There is no accumulated wisdom that helps. Remembering how to navigate a theocratic caste system provides no advantage when the page turns and they're in a post-scarcity anarchist commune. The memories become static, interference, ghosts crowding out the present that demands immediate competence.

The weight is cumulative but never useful.

## Pure Chaos

There is no arc. No lesson crystallizes. No meta-skill emerges for "navigating change." The protagonist does not become more adaptable. They do not discover that love transcends reality, or that identity persists beneath circumstance, or that meaning can be constructed anywhere.

Kafka never let Josef K. understand the Law. Gregor Samsa never learned why he became a bug. The Castle remained inaccessible. The meaningful pattern was precisely its absence.

This novel offers no revelation in the final pages. No frame that makes the suffering coherent. The protagonist does not escape, transcend, or accept. They simply continue. Another page. Another world. Another set of rules already in effect.

If a reader finishes and thinks "ah, so the point was..." — we have failed.

## The Transition Already Complete

Kafka's genius: Gregor does not transform on the page. He wakes up and the transformation has already happened. The horror is not the change but the continuation — the ordinary concerns (will I make my train?) persisting into the extraordinary.

Each page begins with the new reality already established. No transition scenes. No shimmering portals or loss of consciousness. The protagonist is simply *there*, mid-situation, and must perform competence they do not possess.

Page 7 does not end with ominous clouds gathering. Page 8 begins: "The tribunal had been in session for three hours, and they were still waiting for him to explain why he had married outside his caste."

The protagonist has been married. There are castes. A tribunal exists with authority over marriage. These facts arrive without introduction. The reader, like the protagonist, must assemble understanding from context while the situation demands immediate response.

## Bureaucratic Detachment

The prose does not dramatize the strangeness. It describes the impossible with the flat affect of an insurance adjuster documenting a fender-bender.

Not: "To his horror, he realized his left arm had been replaced by a mechanical appendage of gleaming brass and intricate gears."

But: "His mechanical arm needed oiling. The joint had been stiff since Tuesday, and the permits office closed at four."

The protagonist's internal experience may include terror, grief, disorientation. But the narration maintains clerical distance. This gap between content and tone is where the horror lives.

## What Changes

Everything external. Technology, customs, language, political systems, economic structures, social positions, family configurations, physical embodiment, legal status, historical context, geographic location, species composition of society, physics itself when the page demands it.

The changes are not thematically linked. A page about technological upheaval is not followed by another page about technology. There is no "technology chapter." The chaos is genuinely chaotic — marriage, then climate, then caste, then anatomy, then currency, in no meaningful sequence.

## What Persists

Only the protagonist's continuous memory and their name, if they still have one. Even the name may change — imposed by each new reality — while the remembered names accumulate like sediment.

Perhaps not even consciousness persists in a philosophically coherent way. Is it the same person if every context that constitutes personhood has been replaced? The novel does not answer. It does not ask. It simply continues.

## The Reader's Experience

Disorientation matching the protagonist's. No world-building that establishes rules before testing them. Each page demands immediate comprehension of a system that took the inhabitants a lifetime to internalize.

The reader should feel, viscerally, the exhaustion of perpetual adaptation. The impossibility of rest. The way competence in one reality provides no foundation for the next.

Not a puzzle to be solved. Not a metaphor to be decoded. An experience to be endured.

## The Kafka Structure

Kafka provides the architecture. Not the sentence-level prose (that's Knausgaard), but the shape of the novel: how it builds worlds, creates tension, delivers social commentary, and keeps pages turning.

### The Climax in the Opening

Most fiction climaxes near the end. Kafka's fiction climaxes in the opening sentence.

*The Metamorphosis*: "One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin."

*The Trial*: "Someone must have slandered Josef K., for one morning, without having done anything truly wrong, he was arrested."

The irreversible verdict arrives immediately. The remaining story explores consequences.

This novel follows the same structure, but *every page* opens with its own climax. Each page begins with the transformation already complete. The protagonist wakes married, wakes indebted, wakes on trial, wakes with gills — and then navigates the consequences for the remainder of that page.

### Limited Perspective, Shared Bewilderment

Kafka limits narrative to the protagonist's point of view. No omniscient author provides context or explanation. The reader shares the character's confusion without relief.

"In limiting the narrative to the protagonist's point of view, Kafka ensures that the reader will share his character's bewilderment without benefit of an omniscient author."

This novel maintains strict limited perspective. The protagonist doesn't understand the world they've awakened into. Neither does the reader. Context arrives only through what the protagonist can observe, infer, or fail to infer. We are as lost as they are.

### The Parable Form

Kafka's stories most closely resemble parables: "simple yet enigmatic." Settings grow sparse. Detail serves psychological intensity, not world-building. The minimalism forces attention onto internal states and paradox.

Each page is a parable. A complete world rendered in minimal strokes. Not elaborate speculative fiction with detailed histories and magic systems — a situation, a demand, a failure to meet it. The world exists only as far as the protagonist can perceive it in crisis.

### Unresolvable Conflict

Kafka's conflicts cannot be resolved. Josef K. cannot understand the Law. K. cannot reach the Castle. Gregor cannot become human again. The protagonist pursues impossible goals against indifferent systems.

Every page presents an unresolvable conflict. The protagonist must explain why they married outside their caste, but they don't remember the marriage. They must demonstrate skills they don't possess. They must honor vows they don't recall taking. Resolution is structurally impossible — the page will turn before it can arrive.

### Bureaucracy as Antagonist

"The law in Kafka's works, rather than representing any particular legal or political entity, is usually interpreted to represent a collection of anonymous, incomprehensible forces that are hidden from the individual but control people's lives."

Kafka's antagonist is not a person but a system. Labyrinthine bureaucracies, impersonal institutions, anonymous authorities. The enemy has no face, no motive, no negotiating position.

This novel inherits that antagonist. The protagonist battles not villains but systems — tribunals, quotas, regulations, social expectations, economic structures, caste rules, marriage laws. The systems change every page, but the *type* of antagonist remains constant: impersonal forces that cannot be reasoned with.

### Social Commentary Through Absurdity

Kafka critiques modern society by rendering its logic absurd. The dehumanizing nature of capitalism. The indifference of legal systems. The alienation of the individual from community, family, even their own body.

"*The Metamorphosis* serves as a dark critique of the dehumanizing and alienating nature of capitalism."

Each page offers implicit social commentary. A page about mandatory happiness quotas critiques performative wellness culture. A page about time-as-currency critiques the commodification of life. A page about corporate serfdom critiques at-will employment. The commentary emerges from the situation's internal logic, never stated explicitly.

### Tension Without Resolution

Kafka creates tension not through dramatic events but through "prosaic ordinariness." In *The Metamorphosis*, "the shock is all up front. Yet it is the prosaic ordinariness of the balance of the story that builds anxiety and tension."

The protagonist lies confined in a small room. The walls close in. Ordinary details accumulate into unbearable pressure. Nothing dramatic happens — and yet tension mounts.

This novel builds tension page by page through accumulation. Each new world adds weight. The protagonist's competence is tested and found wanting, repeatedly. The tension never releases because no page offers mastery. The protagonist never catches up.

### Page-Turning Through Uncertainty

"Suspense grows steadily throughout the course of a novel while the conflict remains unresolved."

Kafka's readers keep turning pages not for plot resolution but for the next revelation of incomprehensibility. What new impossibility awaits? How will the protagonist fail to navigate it?

Each page ends incomplete. The conflict isn't resolved. The tribunal hasn't rendered judgment. The spouse hasn't been identified. The quota hasn't been met. The page turns, and everything changes anyway. The reader keeps going not to see how it ends but to see what comes next — knowing "what comes next" will be entirely unrelated to what came before.

### World-Building Through Exclusion

Kafka doesn't build worlds. He implies them through what his protagonist doesn't understand. The reader infers vast systems from the protagonist's failures to navigate them.

A tribunal exists. There are procedures. The protagonist doesn't know them. The reader, observing the protagonist's errors, deduces the rules. World-building happens in negative space.

Each page implies a complete world without describing it. The reader encounters a society through its expectations of the protagonist — expectations the protagonist cannot meet. What isn't said reveals more than what is.

### Emotional Resonance Through Restraint

Kafka generates pathos through "spiritual alienation rather than external injustice." His protagonists don't simply suffer mistreatment; they "unconsciously invite their fates" through psychological complexity.

The protagonist's suffering in this novel is not simple victimhood. They remember previous pages. They carry accumulated guilt, grief, confusion. The emotional weight is internal, not externally dramatized. The prose doesn't insist on feeling; it documents circumstances that create feeling.

---

## The Knausgaard Method

The prose style follows Karl Ove Knausgaard's approach in *My Struggle* — a deliberate anti-style that achieves total immersion through flatness, accumulation, and brutal honesty.

### Flatness Over Elegance

Knausgaard rejects the Flaubertian search for *le mot juste*. He does not craft elegant sentences. James Wood describes it: "There is a flatness and a prolixity to the prose; the long sentences have about them an almost careless avant-gardism, with their conversational additions and splayed run-ons. The writer seems not to be selecting or shaping anything, or even pausing to draw breath."

This flatness serves the novel. The prose should feel like consciousness moving at the speed of thought — not polished, not curated, not literary. The reader doesn't admire the sentences; the reader lives inside them.

### Embrace of Cliché

Knausgaard does not avoid cliché. Time falls through his hands "like sand." He falls in love "like being struck by lightning." He is "head over heels," "hungry as a wolf."

This novel permits cliché. When the protagonist's world inverts for the hundredth time, their internal response may be expressed in the most worn phrases available. The exhaustion is real. The language reflects that. Original metaphors would feel false — too energetic for someone who has adapted three hundred times.

### Loping Sentences

Knausgaard's sentences are "loping and gentle, usually unfurling in one direction rather than doubling back and twisting around themselves." They accumulate detail without insisting on that detail's importance. They keep moving forward.

The protagonist wakes in a new reality and the sentence doesn't pause for the reader to absorb the strangeness. It keeps going — what they're wearing, who's in the room, what's expected of them, the temperature, the smell — because consciousness doesn't pause either.

### Mundane Circumstances

Knausgaard achieves profundity through accumulation of the mundane. Tea-making. Sandwich-buttering. Pushing a pram through Stockholm streets. The ordinary becomes extraordinary through sheer presence.

In this novel, each impossible world must be rendered through its ordinary details. The protagonist in a hive-marriage of seventeen spouses doesn't contemplate the existential horror of it. They're trying to remember which spouse is Spouse #8, because tonight is their night, and they're running late.

### Inexhaustible Precision

Description is "the backbone." Not symbol, not metaphor — description. Knausgaard's method is "an exercise of attention" — noticing what others overlook, capturing consciousness in real time.

Each page must describe its world with inexhaustible precision. Not to world-build, but to create presence. The reader should smell the new reality, hear it, feel the specific texture of its bureaucracy against their skin.

### Speed Through Density

"Knausgaard achieves velocity by heaping his (often very lengthy) paragraphs with unlingered-over detail."

The paragraphs move fast despite their length because nothing is emphasized. Details arrive and the prose keeps moving. The reader doesn't have time to contemplate because the protagonist doesn't have time either. Another detail, another demand, another adaptation required.

### The Anti-Proust Mechanism

Knausgaard read Proust and thought he knew how he wanted to write. Then he wrote the opposite. "Anti-Proust."

Proust's sentences double back, qualify, elaborate, refine. Knausgaard's sentences move forward. This novel moves forward. The protagonist cannot linger on what was because what is demands everything.

### Total Immersion

The goal: "total immersion in a story" — the quality of reading as a child, where the world falls away and only the book remains.

Knausgaard achieves this through relentless presence. Not through plot twists or beautiful prose but through the sheer weight of being there, page after page, noticing everything, hiding nothing.

This novel should achieve the same. The reader lives 326 different lives with the protagonist, not because the situations are dramatic (though some are) but because the prose refuses to let them look away.

### Beyond My Struggle: The Fiction

Knausgaard's fiction novels — *A Time for Everything*, *The Morning Star*, *The Wolves of Eternity*, *The Third Realm* — demonstrate how his prose style adapts to invented worlds while maintaining its core characteristics.

**Briskness and Fragmentation**

In *The Morning Star* series, Knausgaard employs "a briskness to the sentences, a fractured and fragmented rhythm." Paragraphs often consist of just one or two sentences. "Thoughts proceed, turn around, double back."

This rhythm suits a novel of perpetual transition. Short paragraphs. Sentences that start moving and then — next paragraph. The fragmentation mirrors the protagonist's fractured experience across 326 realities.

**Restraint Over Sentiment**

When depicting a dying girl's necklace in *The Morning Star*, Knausgaard presents it factually — "plastic beads in all sorts of colors" — rather than using it as a springboard for character reflection. This restraint prioritizes immediate action over nostalgic digression.

This novel must resist the temptation to sentimentalize. The protagonist has lost hundreds of spouses, children, careers. If the prose lingers on each loss, the novel drowns. Factual restraint. The necklace is plastic beads. The spouse is a stranger. Move on.

**Interior Consciousness**

Knausgaard's fiction explores "the habits and syntax of thought" itself. Characters contemplate consciousness rather than external events: "What are thoughts anyway? They come to us as neither images nor sounds, but as something else..."

The protagonist's interior life is the continuity across pages. Their consciousness — how they process, adapt, fail to adapt — remains consistent even as everything external changes. We're inside their habits of thought, watching them try to make sense of the senseless.

**Sinuous Prose for Altered States**

Knausgaard's prose becomes "sinuous" when depicting altered states — music, psychedelics, spiritual experiences. The language mirrors the subject's intensity.

Some pages will require this sinuousness. A page where the protagonist experiences a reality where emotions are externally visible. A page where telepathy exists. A page of dream-logic or religious ecstasy. The prose can shift register to match the altered state while maintaining Knausgaard's fundamental commitments.

**Getting Inside the Text**

Knausgaard insists: "you have to get inside the text… if it feels separate, if you see it from the outside, you collide with it. It doesn't work."

He starts novels "to know almost nothing," approaching writing as "a feeling that you're connected, somehow, to the writing." True engagement means "being at the point where you don't really know… It has to become."

Each page must be written from inside. Not observed from a distance, not planned in advance, but inhabited. The writer, like the protagonist, enters each page without knowing what the world will demand.

**Selflessness in Writing**

When Knausgaard's first novel succeeded, he recognized "it was a moment of writing and being selfless." The self disappears into the work.

The prose should feel authorless. Not stylized in a way that draws attention to craft. Not clever. Not writerly. The prose disappears; the protagonist's experience remains.

**Majesty and Banality Simultaneously**

"Knausgaard remains one of the great chroniclers of the moment-by-moment experience of life. He is acutely in tune with the simultaneity of life's majesty and banality."

Each page holds both. The protagonist stands before a tribunal that will determine their fate (majesty) and notices their left shoe is untied (banality). They're married to a storm system (majesty) and the storm keeps making them late for work (banality). The impossible and the ordinary coexist in every sentence.
