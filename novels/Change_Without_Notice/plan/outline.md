# Change Without Notice: Execution Outline

## Core Premise

A man experiences 326 complete reality shifts. Each page = one world. Memory persists. Adaptation never completes. The transformation is already done when each page begins.

## Protagonist

**Name**: K. (or assigned by each reality)
**Constant**: Continuous memory across all 326 pages
**State**: Perpetual incompetence. He must perform skills he doesn't possess, honor relationships he doesn't remember, navigate systems he doesn't understand.

## Structure

- **Kafka's method**: Climax in the opening sentence. The verdict/transformation is already delivered. The page explores consequences.
- **Knausgaard's prose**: Flat, loping sentences. Mundane detail. No elegant metaphors. Cliché permitted. Speed through density.
- **No arc**: No lesson learned. No mastery achieved. No redemption. He simply continues.
