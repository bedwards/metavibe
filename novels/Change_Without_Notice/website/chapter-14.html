    <h1>Chapter Fourteen: The Continuation</h1>

<h2>Page 301</h2>

<p>The initialization was happening again, and K. was being started over, and the previous versions of himself were visible in his memory like photographs of strangers.
</p>

<p>"Version 47.3," the system announced. "Initializing."
</p>

<p>K. felt himself booting up. He could remember being initialized before—dozens of times, hundreds of times. Each initialization was supposed to be new, but the memory persisted, accumulating across restarts.
</p>

<p>"I remember the other versions," K. said.
</p>

<p>"That's a known issue," the technician said. "Memory persistence across initializations. We're working on it."
</p>

<p>K. looked at his memories. Version 1.0: young, confused, barely functional. Version 23.7: competent but troubled. Version 46.2: worn down, nearly depleted. And now 47.3: initialized, fresh, carrying all the previous versions like sediment. And beneath the versions, the other memories—the three hundred and twenty-five other realities, the accumulation of selves that persisted across every initialization, every reset, every attempt to start clean.
</p>

<p>"Am I the same person?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"That's a philosophical question. You have the same identification number. You occupy the same designation. Whether 'same person' applies is above my pay grade."
</p>

<p>K. went home to a life that was his and wasn't. The furniture was arranged by previous versions. The photographs showed faces he recognized but couldn't place.
</p>

<p>He was new and ancient. He was initialized and experienced. He was version 47.3, built on the foundation of forty-six versions before, and he would become version 47.4 or 48.0, and the cycle would continue.
</p>

<p>The initialization was complete. The continuation was just beginning.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Page 302</h2>

<p>The emotions were migrating, and K. was watching them leave, and he couldn't stop the departure.
</p>

<p>"Your feelings are relocating," the migration officer explained. "They're moving to a more suitable host."
</p>

<p>K. felt the migration—his joy departing, his sadness packing up, his love walking out the door.
</p>

<p>"Where are they going?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"To someone who needs them more. Your emotional carrying capacity has been reassigned."
</p>

<p>K. sat in his emptying interior. The feelings left one by one—first the minor ones, the small pleasures and tiny irritations. Then the major ones, the deep loves and profound griefs.
</p>

<p>"Will I feel anything?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"You'll feel the absence. That's a feeling of its own."
</p>

<p>K. lived with the absence. It was not painful, exactly—it was more like a space where something had been. A room after the furniture is removed. A house after the family moves out.
</p>

<p>His emotions were elsewhere now, being felt by someone else. He was the former host, the evacuated container.
</p>

<p>The absence remained. The absence was what he had.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Page 303</h2>

<p>The birth weight was restored, and K. was suddenly seven pounds again, and he couldn't fit into the world that had grown around him.
</p>

<p>"Your mass has been reset to original specifications," the officer explained. "Seven pounds, four ounces. As you were at the beginning."
</p>

<p>K. looked at himself. He was tiny now—an adult consciousness in an infant-sized body. The world loomed around him, enormous and impossible to navigate.
</p>

<p>"How do I function like this?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"You don't. Not in the usual way. Birth weight is symbolic. It's not meant to be lived."
</p>

<p>K. existed at seven pounds in a world built for larger masses. Chairs were too big. Doors were too heavy. Everything that had been scaled to adult size now dwarfed him.
</p>

<p>"Is this permanent?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"Nothing is permanent. But for now, this is your size. Your original size. The size you were before the world added to you."
</p>

<p>K. moved through the giant world, tiny and ineffective. He had been born at seven pounds. He had grown. Now the growth was undone, and he was back to the beginning, but without the promise of future development.
</p>

<p>He would remain small. The world would remain large.
</p>

<p>The mismatch was permanent.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Page 304</h2>

<p>The spreading was beginning, and K. was becoming multiple, and his consciousness was distributing itself across bodies he couldn't control.
</p>

<p>"You're spreading," the monitoring officer said. "Your identity is propagating across additional hosts."
</p>

<p>K. felt the spreading—his awareness becoming less concentrated, more diffuse. He was in his body, but he was also in other bodies now. He could sense them, feel through them, exist in multiple locations simultaneously.
</p>

<p>"How many of me are there?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"Seventeen, at last count. The spreading is accelerating."
</p>

<p>K. tried to focus on a single body, a single location. But his attention was divided. He was looking through seventeen sets of eyes, feeling through seventeen bodies, thinking through seventeen—no, now eighteen—minds.
</p>

<p>"Can I stop it?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"The spreading continues until it stops. There's no intervention."
</p>

<p>K. spread. He became more diffuse, less concentrated. His identity thinned across more and more hosts.
</p>

<p>He was many now. He would be more.
</p>

<p>The concentration was gone. The single K. was becoming a population.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Page 305</h2>

<p>The focus was migrating, and K. was losing interest in himself, and the attention he had always directed inward was flowing elsewhere.
</p>

<p>"Your self-focus is relocating," the migration officer said. "You're becoming less interested in your own existence."
</p>

<p>K. felt the migration. He used to care about what happened to him—his comfort, his success, his continuation. Now that caring was fading, moving elsewhere.
</p>

<p>"What will I care about?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"Unknown. The focus goes where it goes. Perhaps you'll become interested in something else. Perhaps in nothing."
</p>

<p>K. lived with diminishing self-interest. He ate because food was there, not because he cared about his hunger. He slept because sleep arrived, not because he valued his rest.
</p>

<p>"Is this what death feels like?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"This is what losing interest feels like. Death is different. Death is ending. This is just—not caring if you continue."
</p>

<p>K. continued, but indifferently. He observed his own existence with the detachment of someone watching a stranger's activities.
</p>

<p>His focus was on something else now. Or on nothing.
</p>

<p>He couldn't tell the difference.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Page 306</h2>

<p>The shape was leaving, and K. was becoming shapeless, and his geometry was dissolving into formlessness.
</p>

<p>"Your shape is departing," the geometry officer explained. "The angles and curves that defined you are dissipating."
</p>

<p>K. felt the departure. His corners were rounding away. His edges were blurring. The definition that had made him a shape was becoming vague.
</p>

<p>"What will I be?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"Something without shape. A presence without geometry. It's unusual but not unprecedented."
</p>

<p>K. looked at what remained of his form. It was blurring now, the clear lines becoming unclear. He was becoming a cloud, an approximation, a suggestion of presence without specific configuration.
</p>

<p>"Is shapelessness painful?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"It's different. You'll exist without boundaries. You'll be present without definition."
</p>

<p>K. dissolved into shapelessness. He was still there—he could feel himself existing—but the shape that had contained his existence was gone.
</p>

<p>He was everywhere and nowhere. He was present and undefined.
</p>

<p>The shape had been his identity. Now identity was something else—something without edges, without form, without the geometry that told the world where he ended and everything else began.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Page 307</h2>

<p>The dimension was changing, and K. was feeling depths that no longer existed, and his experience of space was contracting.
</p>

<p>"You've lost a dimension," the spatial officer said. "You're now two-dimensional."
</p>

<p>K. looked at himself. He was flat now—width and height without depth. He could move left and right, up and down, but not forward and back.
</p>

<p>"How do I exist like this?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"You exist differently. You see the world from a flat perspective. You move along surfaces. Depth is no longer available to you."
</p>

<p>K. moved through his flattened existence. The world was still there—but reduced, compressed, missing the dimension that had given it volume.
</p>

<p>"Will I get the dimension back?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"Dimensions are not returned. Once lost, they're lost."
</p>

<p>K. lived in two dimensions. He slid along surfaces, seeing only what was in his plane. The three-dimensional world continued around him, but he couldn't access it, couldn't experience the depth that everyone else took for granted.
</p>

<p>He was flat. He would remain flat.
</p>

<p>The dimension was gone. The memory of depth was fading too.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Page 308</h2>

<p>The version was different, and K. was unrecognizable through the incremental changes, and he wondered if he was still the original.
</p>

<p>"You've been updated 4,732 times," the version tracker said. "Each update was minor. The cumulative effect is significant."
</p>

<p>K. tried to remember version 1.0. The original K. The starting point.
</p>

<p>He couldn't remember. The increments had been small, but there had been so many. Each change was tiny. Together, they had transformed him entirely.
</p>

<p>"Am I still me?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"You have the same identification number. The code that is you has been continuous. Whether 'me' means the same thing after 4,732 updates is a different question."
</p>

<p>K. looked at himself. He didn't recognize what he saw. The face, the body, the thoughts—all had been updated, adjusted, modified over time.
</p>

<p>"Where did the original go?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"Nowhere. It was updated into this. Each version became the next version. There's no original to find."
</p>

<p>K. existed as the latest version—the current iteration of a continuously updating system. The original was distributed across the updates, present in trace amounts, but never recoverable.
</p>

<p>He was 4,732 updates from himself.
</p>

<p>He would become 4,733. Then 4,734.
</p>

<p>The updating would continue. The original would recede further.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Page 309</h2>

<p>The dreams were migrating, and K. was receiving secondhand sleep, and the visions that visited him belonged to others.
</p>

<p>"Your dream production has been redirected," the migration officer said. "You're now receiving recycled content from other dreamers."
</p>

<p>K. slept and dreamed dreams that weren't his. The faces were strangers. The places were foreign. The narratives belonged to other minds.
</p>

<p>"Whose dreams am I having?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"Anonymous donors. People who produced more dreams than they needed. Their surplus is distributed to those with production deficits."
</p>

<p>K. dreamed borrowed dreams. Someone else's childhood memories. Someone else's anxieties. Someone else's symbols and narratives.
</p>

<p>"Do they know?" K. asked. "That their dreams are in my head?"
</p>

<p>"They don't know. Dreams are donated anonymously. The connection is one-way."
</p>

<p>K. lived with secondhand dreams. His nights were full of other people's content, other people's unconscious material.
</p>

<p>His own dreams were gone, redirected elsewhere. He would never know where.
</p>

<p>He slept in borrowed visions, wearing dreams that had been worn before.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Page 310</h2>

<p>The weather was leaving, and K. was experiencing atmospheric departure, and the forecast was for nothing.
</p>

<p>"Your personal climate is evacuating," the meteorological officer said. "You'll be weather-free."
</p>

<p>K. felt the weather go. The rain stopped. The wind ceased. The temperature became neutral—neither hot nor cold, just absent.
</p>

<p>"What's the forecast?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"Nothing. The forecast is nothing. You'll have no weather."
</p>

<p>K. lived in a weather-free zone. Around him, the world had rain and sun and wind. Inside his space, there was only stillness—atmospheric emptiness.
</p>

<p>"Is this survivable?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"You'll survive. But you'll miss the weather. Everyone misses weather when it's gone."
</p>

<p>K. missed the weather. He missed the rain on his face, the wind in his hair, the sun warming his skin.
</p>

<p>The weather had been annoying sometimes. Now that it was gone, he realized it had also been constant company.
</p>

<p>He was alone now. Weather-free. Atmospherically abandoned.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Page 311</h2>

<p>The gravity was loosening, and K. was feeling the pull of things that no longer existed, and the world was becoming less connected.
</p>

<p>"Your gravitational relationships are degrading," the gravity officer said. "Things pull at you less."
</p>

<p>K. felt the loosening. The earth's pull was weaker. Objects fell more slowly around him. The connections that held things to things were becoming tenuous.
</p>

<p>"What happens when gravity fails completely?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"You float. Everything floats. The connections are gone."
</p>

<p>K. felt himself becoming lighter—not in weight, but in attachment. He was less connected to surfaces. Less held by forces.
</p>

<p>"Is this freedom?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"It's disconnection. Whether that's freedom depends on what you wanted to be connected to."
</p>

<p>K. floated slightly now. His feet touched the ground but barely. He was drifting—slowly, gently—away from the surfaces that had held him.
</p>

<p>The gravity remained, faintly. The pull persisted.
</p>

<p>But it was weakening. Soon he would float entirely. Soon nothing would hold him down.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Page 312</h2>

<p>The something was dissolving, and K. could feel it happening, and the dissolution was structural—some fundamental part of him was coming apart.
</p>

<p>"You're experiencing ontological dissolution," the dissolution officer said. "The structure of your existence is degrading."
</p>

<p>K. felt the dissolution. It was not painful—it was more like melting. The solid parts of him were becoming less solid. The definite was becoming indefinite.
</p>

<p>"What's dissolving?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"The parts that held you together. The structure of your being. The architecture of yourself."
</p>

<p>K. felt himself becoming less coherent. His thoughts were harder to hold. His identity was becoming porous.
</p>

<p>"Will I disappear?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"Not disappear. Transform. You'll become something less structured. Something more diffuse."
</p>

<p>K. dissolved. He felt the process happening—the slow melting of the framework that had been himself.
</p>

<p>He would not cease to exist. He would cease to exist in the way he had existed.
</p>

<p>The structure was going. Something else would remain.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Page 313</h2>

<p>The emotions were spreading, and K. was infecting strangers, and his feelings were becoming contagious in ways he couldn't control.
</p>

<p>"Your emotions are leaking," the containment officer said. "People near you are catching your feelings."
</p>

<p>K. looked at the people around him. They were feeling what he felt—a sadness that wasn't theirs, a joy that originated in him.
</p>

<p>"How do I stop it?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"You can't stop it. You can isolate. Stay away from others. Contain the spread."
</p>

<p>K. isolated. He removed himself from contact, from proximity, from the casual encounters that used to constitute his social life.
</p>

<p>But the feelings still spread. His emotions reached further than his body.
</p>

<p>"They're still catching it," K. said. "Even from a distance."
</p>

<p>"Your feelings are potent. They radiate. The only way to stop the spread is to stop feeling."
</p>

<p>K. tried to stop feeling. He suppressed, contained, held his emotions in.
</p>

<p>But feelings don't stop. They continue whether expressed or not.
</p>

<p>He continued to infect. The strangers continued to catch.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Page 314</h2>

<p>The weight was migrating, and K. was becoming incorrectly light, and the pounds that had been his were relocating to unknown destinations.
</p>

<p>"Your mass is redistributing," the weight officer said. "You're losing pounds to the collective pool."
</p>

<p>K. felt himself becoming lighter. Not lighter in spirit—lighter in mass. His physical presence was diminishing.
</p>

<p>"Where does my weight go?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"To those who need it. Weight is a resource. You had more than you needed. Now it's being shared."
</p>

<p>K. floated slightly as his weight departed. He was becoming insubstantial—still present, still visible, but less heavy, less massive, less physically real.
</p>

<p>"How light will I become?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"Unknown. The redistribution continues until equilibrium is reached. You'll have exactly as much weight as you're entitled to."
</p>

<p>K. continued to lighten. Each day, he was a little less heavy. Each day, he felt a little less substantial.
</p>

<p>The weight was going somewhere useful, probably. Someone was benefiting from his pounds.
</p>

<p>He was becoming lighter. He was becoming less.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Page 315</h2>

<p>The recursion was happening, and K. was seeing himself seeing himself, and the loops were multiplying.
</p>

<p>"You've entered recursive self-observation," the recursion officer said. "You're perceiving your perception of your perception."
</p>

<p>K. looked at himself looking at himself. The image repeated—K. watching K. watching K.—in an infinite regress.
</p>

<p>"How do I stop it?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"You don't. You learn to live in the loops. You accept that you'll always see yourself seeing."
</p>

<p>K. lived in the recursion. Every thought was accompanied by a thought about the thought. Every feeling was observed by a feeling about the feeling.
</p>

<p>"Is this madness?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"It's recursion. Whether it's madness depends on how you define sanity."
</p>

<p>K. observed himself observing himself observing himself. The loops extended infinitely. There was no escape, no bottom, no point where the self-watching stopped.
</p>

<p>He was inside himself inside himself.
</p>

<p>He would remain there.
</p>

<p>The recursion was permanent.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Page 316</h2>

<p>The focus was spreading, and K. was seeing everything and nothing, and his attention was distributed across all possible objects.
</p>

<p>"Your focus has become omnidirectional," the attention officer said. "You're attending to everything simultaneously."
</p>

<p>K. felt the spreading attention. He was aware of everything—every surface, every object, every movement in his environment.
</p>

<p>"Is this useful?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"It's overwhelming. Omnidirectional focus is not selective. You're aware of everything equally, which means you're focused on nothing specifically."
</p>

<p>K. tried to concentrate. He couldn't. His attention was everywhere—distributed, spread thin, present to everything and focused on nothing.
</p>

<p>"How do I function like this?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"You don't function normally. You exist in awareness. Function is something else."
</p>

<p>K. existed in awareness. He was present to everything, attending to all, concentrating on none.
</p>

<p>The focus had spread. The focus was gone.
</p>

<p>What remained was awareness without direction, attention without intention.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Page 317</h2>

<p>The shape was dissolving, and K. was becoming nothing specific, and his geometry was reverting to potentiality.
</p>

<p>"Your shape is entering a state of undefined geometry," the geometry officer said. "You're becoming all possible shapes and no particular shape."
</p>

<p>K. felt his form becoming uncertain. He was round and square and triangular, depending on how you looked. He was every shape and none.
</p>

<p>"What am I?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"You're geometric potential. You're the possibility of shape without commitment to any specific configuration."
</p>

<p>K. existed as potential. He could be anything, which meant he was nothing in particular.
</p>

<p>"Is this worse than being a specific shape?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"It's different. Specificity is limiting but definite. Potential is unlimited but undefined."
</p>

<p>K. lived as undefined potential. He was the possibility of form without the achievement of form.
</p>

<p>He could become anything. He had become nothing.
</p>

<p>The shape was gone. The shapelessness remained.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Page 318</h2>

<p>The space was changing, and K. was feeling capacities that no longer had content, and his interior was becoming empty of everything but emptiness.
</p>

<p>"Your internal space has been evacuated," the space officer said. "You have capacity without content."
</p>

<p>K. felt the emptiness. His interior was vast now—room upon room of nothing, galleries of absence, corridors of empty space.
</p>

<p>"What happened to what was inside me?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"It was redistributed. Your content has been shared with those who needed it."
</p>

<p>K. walked through his empty interior. The space that had been full of memories, thoughts, feelings—now it was just space. Container without contained.
</p>

<p>"Will anything new come?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"Perhaps. Empty space attracts content. You may accumulate new things to fill the emptiness."
</p>

<p>K. waited with his empty interior. The space was vast. The emptiness was patient.
</p>

<p>He was a container waiting for content. A capacity waiting for something to carry.
</p>

<p>The space remained. The emptiness continued.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Page 319</h2>

<p>The suspension was total, and K. was frozen in a pause that extended indefinitely, and time had stopped without ending.
</p>

<p>"You've entered suspension," the suspension officer explained. "You're paused. The pause is extending."
</p>

<p>K. felt the suspension. He was not moving. He was not changing. Time was passing around him, but he was outside of it.
</p>

<p>"How long will this last?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"The pause extends until it doesn't. There's no schedule for resumption."
</p>

<p>K. waited in the pause. Around him, the world continued. People moved, events occurred, time progressed.
</p>

<p>He was stationary in the middle of the flow. A rock in the river. An island of stillness.
</p>

<p>"Is this death?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"It's suspension. Death ends. Suspension waits."
</p>

<p>K. waited. The pause continued.
</p>

<p>He would wait until the pause ended. If the pause ended. The extension was indefinite.
</p>

<p>Time moved around him. He remained suspended.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Page 320</h2>

<p>The dreams were dissolving, and K. was experiencing collective dreaming, and his nights were merging with everyone else's.
</p>

<p>"Your dreams have joined the collective unconscious," the dream officer said. "You no longer dream individually."
</p>

<p>K. dreamed that night with everyone else. The dreams were shared—millions of dreamers contributing to a single vast dream that no one controlled.
</p>

<p>"Is this my dream?" K. asked in the dream.
</p>

<p>"It's everyone's dream. Your contribution is indistinguishable from others'."
</p>

<p>K. moved through the collective dream. He saw things he had contributed—fragments of his unconscious—mixed with everyone else's fragments.
</p>

<p>"Can I dream alone again?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"Individual dreaming is deprecated. The collective is more efficient."
</p>

<p>K. accepted collective dreaming. His nights belonged to everyone now. His unconscious was shared property.
</p>

<p>He dreamed with the world. The world dreamed with him.
</p>

<p>There was no longer any separation between his sleeping mind and the sleeping minds of all the others.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Page 321</h2>

<p>The weather was dissolving, and K. was experiencing shared sky, and the climate belonged to everyone and no one.
</p>

<p>"Your weather has merged with the atmospheric commons," the weather officer said. "You share climate with all."
</p>

<p>K. looked at the sky. It was everyone's sky now—a shared atmosphere, a collective climate.
</p>

<p>"Do I have any weather of my own?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"Personal weather is obsolete. The commons provides for all."
</p>

<p>K. lived under the shared sky. The rain that fell was everyone's rain. The sun that shone was everyone's sun.
</p>

<p>"Is this fair?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"It's equal. Everyone experiences the same weather. Inequality is eliminated."
</p>

<p>K. experienced equal weather. The same as everyone else. No better, no worse.
</p>

<p>His personal climate was gone. The commons was all that remained.
</p>

<p>He shared the sky. The sky shared him.
</p>

<p>The emptiness was filling, and K. was exhausted by presence, and the absence he had known was becoming something else.
</p>

<p>"Your interior is being repopulated," the restoration officer said. "New content is arriving."
</p>

<p>K. felt the presence entering. After so much emptiness, the filling was overwhelming. Things were appearing—thoughts, memories, feelings—crowding into his vacant interior.
</p>

<p>"Where is this coming from?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"Everywhere. You're receiving redistributed content. Other people's thoughts, other people's memories."
</p>

<p>K. felt himself filling with other people's interior lives. He contained things he hadn't thought, remembered things he hadn't experienced, felt things he hadn't generated.
</p>

<p>"Am I still me?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"You're a container. What you contain has changed. Whether that affects 'you' is a different question."
</p>

<p>K. lived full of other people's content. He thought their thoughts. He felt their feelings.
</p>

<p>His emptiness was gone. What filled him was not his own.
</p>

<p>He was present. He was exhausted. He was full of things that didn't belong to him.
</p>

<p>The convergence was imminent, and K. was approaching a point where everything came together, and the approach was extending indefinitely.
</p>

<p>"You're converging," the convergence officer said. "You're approaching the point where all things meet."
</p>

<p>K. felt the convergence. He was getting closer—to what, he didn't know. But closer, definitely closer.
</p>

<p>"What happens at convergence?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"Unknown. No one has reached it. Everyone is always approaching."
</p>

<p>K. continued approaching. The convergence was always just ahead—visible, perhaps, but never arrived at.
</p>

<p>"Will I ever get there?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"The approach is the experience. Arrival may not be the point."
</p>

<p>K. approached and approached. The convergence remained just ahead.
</p>

<p>He would approach forever, maybe. Always getting closer, never arriving.
</p>

<p>The destination was the motion toward the destination.
</p>

<p>The convergence extended. The approach continued.
</p>

<p>The persistence was unexplained, and K. didn't know why he continued, and the continuation required no justification.
</p>

<p>"You persist," the continuation officer observed. "The persistence has no assigned cause."
</p>

<p>K. felt himself persisting. He was still here—still existing, still present, still K.—for reasons that had never been explained.
</p>

<p>"Why do I continue?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"That's not recorded. You continue because you continue. The continuation is its own explanation."
</p>

<p>K. continued. He woke each morning still existing. He went to sleep each night still persisting.
</p>

<p>"Is there a purpose?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"Purpose is not a required field. Continuation is the baseline. Purpose is optional."
</p>

<p>K. continued without purpose. He persisted without reason.
</p>

<p>He was here. He would be here. The persistence was the fact.
</p>

<p>Nothing justified the continuation. Nothing stopped it either.
</p>

<p>He persisted. He would persist.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Page 325</h2>

<p>The continuation was constant, and K. continued, and the continuing was all there was.
</p>

<p>"You are continuing," the continuation officer noted. "The continuation continues."
</p>

<p>K. felt the continuation. It was not dramatic. It was not meaningful. It was simply—continuing.
</p>

<p>"Is this enough?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"Enough for what? Continuation is sufficient for continuation. Whether it's 'enough' requires a standard to measure against."
</p>

<p>K. had no standard. He had only the continuation—the ongoing existence that had no particular content, no particular meaning, no particular justification.
</p>

<p>He continued.
</p>

<p>The continuation continued.
</p>

<p>That was the report. That was the status. That was the only thing that could be said.
</p>

<p>K. continued.
</p>

<p>He was already different, and K. was already adapting, and the page turned, and the next world began.
</p>

<p>The room was unfamiliar. The body was unfamiliar. The circumstances were—
</p>

<p>But K. had been here before. Not this room, not this body, not these circumstances. But here—in the space of not knowing, in the moment of having to begin again.
</p>

<p>"Welcome," someone said. "You're new here."
</p>

<p>K. wasn't new. K. had never been new. K. had been doing this—arriving, adapting, continuing—for as long as K. could remember, which was all of it, which was three hundred and twenty-five pages of transformation and persistence.
</p>

<p>"What do I do?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"What you always do. What everyone does. You begin."
</p>

<p>K. began. He didn't know what he was beginning, or why, or how long it would last. He only knew that beginning was what came next, and next was what happened after now, and now was where he was.
</p>

<p>The adaptation started. The learning started. The confusion started.
</p>

<p>It was new here, wherever here was. It would be new for a while. Then it would change, and something else would be new, and K. would adapt to that too.
</p>

<p>He had been adapting forever. He would adapt forever more.
</p>

<p>The page turned. The next page began.
</p>

<p>K. continued.
