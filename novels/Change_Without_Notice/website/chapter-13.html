    <h1>Chapter Thirteen: The Systems Persist (Part II)</h1>

<h2>World 276</h2>

<p>The tuning was for weather, and K.'s climate was being fine-adjusted, and the meteorological technician was explaining that atmospheric precision was essential.
</p>

<p>"Precipitation patterns 4.7% off target," the technician said. "Correcting variance."
</p>

<p>K. felt the tuning—rain becoming precise, clouds predictable, weather aligning with specifications.
</p>

<p>"What's the target?"
</p>

<p>"The weather you were assigned. Everyone receives assigned weather. Deviation is inefficient."
</p>

<p>He emerged with tuned weather. Rain exactly when scheduled. Sunshine exactly when planned. Precision-engineered climate.
</p>

<p>The tuning had removed something—surprise. The unexpected storm. The clearing that came when it wasn't supposed to.
</p>

<p>"Is this what weather should feel like?"
</p>

<p>"This is assigned weather. Natural weather was unpredictable. Assigned weather is reliable."
</p>

<p>Reliable weather. Never surprised him. Never inconvenienced him.
</p>

<p>Never delighted him either.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>World 277</h2>

<p>The echoes were returning, and K. was hearing reverberations of things he had said years ago, and the echo authority was explaining that sound persistence was a normal phenomenon.
</p>

<p>"Your voice has been echoing approximately twelve years," the officer said. "Sounds from 2045 returning now."
</p>

<p>K. listened. He could hear himself—younger, different—saying things he didn't remember. Delayed recordings, bouncing back from wherever sound went.
</p>

<p>"What am I saying?"
</p>

<p>"Conversations, exclamations, ordinary speech. Everything you ever said is still traveling. Eventually returning."
</p>

<p>He heard himself arguing. The words distant but recognizable. Heard himself laughing—thin but genuine.
</p>

<p>"Will this continue?"
</p>

<p>"Until all sounds return. Sound doesn't disappear. It travels."
</p>

<p>Each day: new echoes. Fragments of old conversations. His past arriving audibly, inescapably. He heard regrets. Promises unkept. History returning sound by sound.
</p>

<p>"Is there a way to stop them?"
</p>

<p>"No. What you said is what you said. The return is inevitable."
</p>

<hr>

<h2>World 278</h2>

<p>The updates were mandatory, and K. was being updated, and the update center was explaining that regular revisions were necessary for optimal functioning.
</p>

<p>"Software version 47.3," the technician said. "Updating to 47.4. Two hours."
</p>

<p>K. didn't know he had software. Didn't know he was versioned.
</p>

<p>"What's being updated?"
</p>

<p>"Core functionality. Emotional processing. Cognitive algorithms. Improvement."
</p>

<p>He felt changes happening—subtle shifts in thought, feeling, processing.
</p>

<p>Version 47.4.
</p>

<p>"How do you feel?"
</p>

<p>"Different."
</p>

<p>He went home and compared himself to 47.3. Faster thinking. Less intense feeling. More efficient processing.
</p>

<p>Improvement meant loss—slower thinking, deeper feeling, inefficiencies that had been part of who he was.
</p>

<p>"Am I still me?"
</p>

<p>"You're the current version. Previous versions are obsolete."
</p>

<p>47.4. The 47.3 that existed before: gone, replaced, updated into oblivion.
</p>

<p>Next update already scheduled.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>World 279</h2>

<p>The standardization was for emotions, and K. was being made standard, and the process would align his feelings with the universal template.
</p>

<p>"Emotional configuration shows significant individual variation," the standardizer said. "Adjusting to match standard."
</p>

<p>K. felt his individual emotions—the particular way he experienced things. About to be standardized.
</p>

<p>"What will I lose?"
</p>

<p>"Distinctiveness. Uniqueness. Variations that make emotions specifically yours."
</p>

<p>He underwent standardization. Feelings adjusted, calibrated, aligned with universal template.
</p>

<p>His joy: everyone's joy. His anger: universal anger. His love: interchangeable with standard love.
</p>

<p>"How do you feel?"
</p>

<p>"The same as everyone."
</p>

<p>Standard emotions. When he felt something, he knew exactly what it was—recognizable to all, shareable without translation.
</p>

<p>But not his anymore. The emotions. The feelings everyone felt. Universal template applied to particular body.
</p>

<p>He felt like everyone. He was no one in particular.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>World 280</h2>

<p>The calibration was for weight, and K. was being precisely measured, and the calibration office was explaining that mass accuracy was essential.
</p>

<p>"Your weight is 0.3 pounds off calibration," the calibrator said. "We're adjusting you to the exact target."
</p>

<p>K. felt the calibration—a tiny adjustment, a minor correction, his mass being brought into precise alignment.
</p>

<p>"Is 0.3 pounds significant?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"All deviation is significant. Precision is the goal. Your weight must be exactly what it's supposed to be."
</p>

<p>K. emerged calibrated. He weighed exactly what the specification said he should weigh. Not 0.3 pounds more, not 0.3 pounds less.
</p>

<p>"How do you feel?" the calibrator asked.
</p>

<p>"Precise. I feel precise."
</p>

<p>K. lived with calibrated weight. His mass was exactly correct. He knew, to the ounce, what he weighed at any moment.
</p>

<p>The precision was comforting, in a way. No surprises. No variation. Just the exact weight he was supposed to have.
</p>

<p>But he wondered about the 0.3 pounds. Where had they gone? Were they floating somewhere, displaced by calibration? Were they looking for a body to attach to?
</p>

<p>He was precisely correct. The imprecision had been removed.
</p>

<p>He was exactly what he should be.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>World 281</h2>

<p>The restoration was for focus, and K. was having his attention repaired, and the process would fix the damage from years of distraction.
</p>

<p>"Your focus has been fragmented," the restoration technician said. "We're piecing it back together."
</p>

<p>K. felt the restoration—his scattered attention being gathered, reassembled, made whole.
</p>

<p>"How did it fragment?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"Use. Overuse. The demands of modern life fracture attention. We're repairing the fractures."
</p>

<p>K. emerged with restored focus. He could attend to things completely—single-pointed awareness, undivided concentration.
</p>

<p>"How do you feel?" the technician asked.
</p>

<p>"Whole. My attention feels whole."
</p>

<p>K. lived with whole attention. He could focus on one thing at a time, entirely, without the fragmentation that had distributed his awareness across multiple stimuli.
</p>

<p>But something was different. The fractured attention had seen more—multiple things simultaneously, connections between disparate elements. The whole attention saw less, but saw it completely.
</p>

<p>He was restored. He was also reduced.
</p>

<p>The fragmentation had been a kind of richness. The wholeness was a kind of poverty.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>World 282</h2>

<p>The normalization was for focus, and K. was being brought into standard attentional range, and the process would make his concentration average.
</p>

<p>"Your focus exceeds normal parameters," the normalizer said. "You concentrate too intensely. We're reducing it to acceptable levels."
</p>

<p>K. felt the reduction—his intense concentration being diluted, spread thinner, made average.
</p>

<p>"Is there such a thing as too much focus?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"There is. Excessive concentration is isolating. You miss peripheral awareness. You disconnect from the collective attention."
</p>

<p>K. emerged with normal focus. He could attend to things, but not too much. His concentration was average—neither deficient nor excessive.
</p>

<p>"How do you feel?" the normalizer asked.
</p>

<p>"Normal. I feel normal."
</p>

<p>K. lived with normal focus. He noticed things adequately. He concentrated sufficiently.
</p>

<p>The intensity was gone. The deep dives into single subjects, the hours of complete immersion—these were no longer possible.
</p>

<p>He was part of the collective attention now. His focus matched everyone else's.
</p>

<p>He noticed what everyone noticed, with the depth that everyone achieved.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>World 283</h2>

<p>The normalization was for shapes, and K. was being geometrically averaged, and the process would make his form unremarkable.
</p>

<p>"Your shape has distinctive features," the normalizer said. "We're removing them."
</p>

<p>K. looked at his shape. The distinctive features were small—a slightly unusual angle, a curve with particular character. They were what made his geometry his.
</p>

<p>"Why remove them?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"Distinction creates friction. Average shapes interface smoothly. Your features cause compatibility issues."
</p>

<p>K. underwent normalization. His distinctive features were removed, averaged, blended into the geometric mean.
</p>

<p>When it was over, he was average. His angles matched the standard. His curves followed the template.
</p>

<p>"How do you feel?" the normalizer asked.
</p>

<p>"Compatible. I feel compatible."
</p>

<p>K. lived as an average shape. He fit everywhere. He interfaced smoothly.
</p>

<p>But he couldn't be recognized. His shape, once distinctive, now matched countless others. He was interchangeable, replaceable, one geometry among many.
</p>

<p>The distinction had been him. The average was everyone.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>World 284</h2>

<p>The speeds were changing, and K. was moving at different rates, and the velocity authority was explaining that speed variance was being corrected.
</p>

<p>"Your movement speed has been inconsistent," the officer said. "You accelerate and decelerate unpredictably. We're standardizing your velocity."
</p>

<p>K. felt the standardization—his movements becoming uniform, his speed becoming constant.
</p>

<p>"What was wrong with varying speed?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"Variance disrupts flow. When everyone moves at the same rate, traffic is optimized. Your unpredictability was causing problems."
</p>

<p>K. emerged with standardized velocity. He moved at a constant speed—neither rushing nor dawdling, just the standard pace.
</p>

<p>"How do you feel?" the officer asked.
</p>

<p>"Steady. I feel steady."
</p>

<p>K. lived at constant speed. He walked the same pace everywhere. He never hurried, never slowed.
</p>

<p>The variation had been responsive—faster when excited, slower when tired. The constancy was mechanical.
</p>

<p>He moved like everyone else now. His body had lost its rhythm.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>World 285</h2>

<p>The transition was continuing, and K. was still becoming, and the becoming had no apparent destination.
</p>

<p>"You're in permanent transition," the transition counselor said. "You're always becoming what you'll be next."
</p>

<p>K. felt the transition—the constant change, the endless becoming, the state of never quite arriving.
</p>

<p>"When do I stop becoming?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"When you cease existing. Becoming is existence. Stability is death."
</p>

<p>K. lived in transition. Each moment, he was slightly different than the moment before. Each day, he was a new version of whoever he had been yesterday.
</p>

<p>"Is this normal?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"This is universal. Everyone is becoming. Most people don't notice. You've become aware of your becoming."
</p>

<p>K. was aware of his becoming. He felt himself changing—minute by minute, hour by hour. The person he was kept slipping away, replaced by the person he was becoming.
</p>

<p>"Will I ever know who I am?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"You'll know who you were. Who you are is already becoming who you'll be. The present is too brief for knowing."
</p>

<p>K. continued to transition. He continued to become.
</p>

<p>He never arrived. He never stopped. He was perpetual motion, permanent change, a person made of becoming.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>World 286</h2>

<p>The normalization was for dreams, and K. was having his sleep standardized, and the process would make his nights predictable.
</p>

<p>"Your dreams show unusual content," the normalizer said. "We're adjusting them to match the standard."
</p>

<p>K. felt the adjustment—his dream content being modified, his unconscious production being brought into alignment.
</p>

<p>"What's unusual about my dreams?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"They're too original. Too distinctive. Standard dreams draw from common imagery. Yours draw from somewhere else."
</p>

<p>K. emerged with normalized dreams. That night, he dreamed standard dreams—the common imagery, the shared symbols, the nocturnal content that everyone experienced.
</p>

<p>"How do you feel?" the normalizer asked the next day.
</p>

<p>"Rested. My dreams made sense."
</p>

<p>K. lived with standard dreams. His nights were predictable. His dreams were comprehensible.
</p>

<p>The unusual content was gone. The strange images, the distinctive narratives—these no longer visited him.
</p>

<p>His unconscious was normal now. His sleep was shared.
</p>

<p>He dreamed what everyone dreamed. He was no longer alone in his nights.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>World 287</h2>

<p>The normalization was for weather, and K.'s climate was being standardized, and the process would make his atmospheric experience uniform.
</p>

<p>"Your weather shows individual variation," the normalizer said. "We're aligning it with the collective."
</p>

<p>K. felt his weather changing—his personal climate becoming average, his atmospheric experience matching everyone else's.
</p>

<p>"What happens to my seasons?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"They'll be everyone's seasons. The same weather everyone experiences. Uniform conditions across all citizens."
</p>

<p>K. emerged with standard weather. Rain came when everyone's rain came. Sun shone when everyone's sun shone.
</p>

<p>"How do you feel?" the normalizer asked.
</p>

<p>"Connected. I feel connected."
</p>

<p>K. lived with collective weather. His climate matched his neighbors'. The distinctions that had made his atmospheric experience personal were gone.
</p>

<p>He no longer had his own rain. He no longer had his own sun.
</p>

<p>He shared weather with everyone, which meant the weather was no one's.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>World 288</h2>

<p>The silences were returning, and K. was hearing the absences of things he had never said, and the silence authority was explaining that unsaid things had presence too.
</p>

<p>"The things you didn't say are returning as silence," the officer said. "Every word you held back, every thought you didn't voice—they're coming back as quiet."
</p>

<p>K. listened. He could hear the silences—gaps in sound, absences of speech, the negative space of communication.
</p>

<p>"What didn't I say?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"That's between you and your silences. The content is yours."
</p>

<p>K. lived with returning silences. Each day brought more—moments of quiet that were somehow specific, absences that had content.
</p>

<p>He heard the things he should have said to people now gone. He heard the words he had swallowed, the truths he had suppressed.
</p>

<p>"How long do they last?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"Until you hear them all. Every silence you created will return."
</p>

<p>The silences accumulated. K.'s life filled with the echoes of unsaying, the reverberations of restraint.
</p>

<p>He had been silent so often. The silences were many.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>World 289</h2>

<p>The migration was for emotions, and K.'s feelings were relocating, and the process would move them to more efficient locations.
</p>

<p>"Your emotions are poorly distributed," the migration officer said. "We're moving them for optimal access."
</p>

<p>K. felt the migration—his feelings relocating, settling into new positions within his psychological architecture.
</p>

<p>"Where are they going?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"Joy is moving to the surface. Grief is moving deeper. Anger is being repositioned for quick deployment. Each emotion is being placed where it functions best."
</p>

<p>K. emerged with migrated emotions. Joy was easily accessible now—right at the surface. Grief was harder to reach—buried deep.
</p>

<p>"How do you feel?" the officer asked.
</p>

<p>"Efficient. I feel efficient."
</p>

<p>K. lived with efficient emotions. Joy came quickly, easily. Grief required effort to access.
</p>

<p>The arrangement was optimal. The feelings served their purposes.
</p>

<p>But something was wrong. The old arrangement had been organic—emotions emerging as they would, not as they should. The new arrangement was engineered.
</p>

<p>He felt efficiently. He wasn't sure he felt authentically.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>World 290</h2>

<p>The rotation was for roles, and K. was cycling through identities, and the rotation office was explaining that regular role changes prevented stagnation.
</p>

<p>"You've been in your current role for too long," the officer said. "We're rotating you to a new identity."
</p>

<p>K. felt the rotation—his current role dissolving, a new identity installing.
</p>

<p>"What will I be?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"That's determined by the rotation schedule. You don't choose. You adapt."
</p>

<p>K. emerged with a new role. He was something else now—a different profession, a different set of relationships, a different way of being in the world.
</p>

<p>"How do you feel?" the officer asked.
</p>

<p>"Disoriented. I feel disoriented."
</p>

<p>K. lived with his new role. He learned its requirements, adapted to its expectations. He became who the rotation said he was.
</p>

<p>But traces of the old role remained. The person he had been leaked into the person he was. The rotation was not complete.
</p>

<p>"Will this ever feel natural?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"With time. Each role becomes natural. Then it rotates, and you adapt again."
</p>

<p>K. adapted. He would rotate. He would become something else, then something else again.
</p>

<p>The stagnation was prevented. The identity was fluid.
</p>

<p>He was what he was rotated into being.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>World 291</h2>

<p>The restoration was for focus, and K. was being repaired again, and the technicians were explaining that attention required ongoing maintenance.
</p>

<p>"Your focus has degraded since your last restoration," the technician said. "We're restoring again."
</p>

<p>K. felt the restoration—his attention being rebuilt, patched, brought back to functional levels.
</p>

<p>"How often does this happen?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"Regularly. Focus degrades with use. Restoration is a recurring requirement."
</p>

<p>K. emerged restored. His attention was sharp again, capable of sustained concentration.
</p>

<p>"How do you feel?" the technician asked.
</p>

<p>"Temporarily fixed. I feel temporarily fixed."
</p>

<p>K. lived with his temporarily fixed focus. He knew it would degrade again. He knew restoration would be needed again.
</p>

<p>The cycle was endless. Degradation and restoration. Loss and repair.
</p>

<p>His attention was never permanently whole. It was always breaking down, always being fixed, always in a state of maintenance.
</p>

<p>"Is this sustainable?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"Sustainability is not the goal. Function is the goal. You function, for now."
</p>

<p>K. functioned. For now.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>World 292</h2>

<p>The restoration was for shapes, and K.'s geometry was being repaired, and the process would fix the deformations that time had caused.
</p>

<p>"Your shape has degraded," the restorer said. "Your angles are worn. Your curves are flattening."
</p>

<p>K. looked at his geometry. It was worn, certainly—decades of existence had eroded his original form.
</p>

<p>"Can you restore it completely?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"To original specifications. You'll be as sharp as when you were new."
</p>

<p>K. underwent restoration. His worn angles were sharpened. His flattening curves were raised.
</p>

<p>When it was over, he was geometrically new. His shape matched his original configuration.
</p>

<p>"How do you feel?" the restorer asked.
</p>

<p>"New. I feel new."
</p>

<p>K. lived with his restored shape. He was sharp again, defined again, the geometry he had been at the beginning.
</p>

<p>But the sharpness felt artificial. His original shape had come naturally. This shape was engineered.
</p>

<p>He looked new. He didn't feel new.
</p>

<p>The restoration was physical. The experience of aging was still inside, pressing against the restored surfaces.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>World 293</h2>

<p>The temperatures were changing, and K. was experiencing thermal flux, and the temperature authority was explaining that heat stability was no longer guaranteed.
</p>

<p>"Your personal temperature has been fluctuating," the officer said. "We can no longer maintain thermal constancy."
</p>

<p>K. felt the fluctuations—warmer one moment, cooler the next. His body temperature was no longer stable.
</p>

<p>"What's causing this?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"System overload. Too many temperature requests. Resources are stretched. Fluctuation is the result."
</p>

<p>K. lived with thermal flux. He was never sure if he would be warm or cold. His temperature changed without warning.
</p>

<p>"Is this dangerous?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"Not immediately. But thermal instability is uncomfortable. Most people find it distressing."
</p>

<p>K. found it distressing. He dressed in layers. He carried both fans and blankets. He prepared for any temperature.
</p>

<p>"Will stability return?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"Unknown. The system is under strain. Stability may never return."
</p>

<p>K. lived in thermal uncertainty. His temperature was no longer his. It was the result of forces beyond his control.
</p>

<p>He adapted. He had no choice.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>World 294</h2>

<p>The termination was postponed, and K. was still existing, and the termination office was explaining that his ending had been delayed for administrative reasons.
</p>

<p>"Your termination has been rescheduled," the officer said. "The new date will be communicated when determined."
</p>

<p>K. felt relief, confusion, and something else—disappointment, perhaps. He had been prepared to end. Now ending was postponed.
</p>

<p>"How long do I wait?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"Indefinitely. Terminations are processed in order. Your position in the queue has changed."
</p>

<p>K. went home with his postponed termination. He had been ready to cease. Now he had to continue, with no clear end point.
</p>

<p>"Is this better?" he asked himself.
</p>

<p>He couldn't answer. Extension was not the same as life. Postponement was not the same as continuation.
</p>

<p>He was existing on borrowed time, deferred existence, a life that should have ended but hadn't, not because of value but because of administrative delay.
</p>

<p>He would live until the rescheduled termination. Then he would end.
</p>

<p>Unless that termination was also postponed.
</p>

<p>The uncertainty was its own kind of ending—an existence suspended, neither living nor dying, waiting in a queue for a conclusion that kept retreating.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>World 295</h2>

<p>The restoration was for dreams, and K. was having his nights repaired, and the technicians were explaining that dream restoration was delicate work.
</p>

<p>"Your dreams have been damaged," the technician said. "They're producing less content than expected."
</p>

<p>K. didn't know dreams could be damaged. He slept, he dreamed, he woke. The process seemed automatic.
</p>

<p>"What happened to them?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"Wear. Strain. The normal degradation of nocturnal function."
</p>

<p>K. underwent dream restoration. His sleeping capacity was repaired, enhanced, brought back to productive levels.
</p>

<p>That night, he dreamed more than he had in years. The dreams were vivid, extensive, full of content that had been absent.
</p>

<p>"How do you feel?" the technician asked.
</p>

<p>"Like I've been missing something. And now it's back."
</p>

<p>K. lived with restored dreams. His nights were rich again, productive again.
</p>

<p>But the restored dreams felt different. They were fuller, yes—but they had the quality of things manufactured rather than grown.
</p>

<p>His dreams were working. Whether they were truly his was a different question.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>World 296</h2>

<p>The restoration was for weather, and K.'s climate was being repaired, and the meteorological technicians were explaining that atmospheric damage was reversible.
</p>

<p>"Your weather has deteriorated," the technician said. "Storms are weaker. Sunshine is dimmer. We're restoring intensity."
</p>

<p>K. felt the restoration—his weather becoming stronger, his climate recovering its original force.
</p>

<p>"What caused the deterioration?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"Use. All weather degrades with use. Restoration is routine."
</p>

<p>K. emerged with restored weather. Storms were powerful again. Sunshine was bright again.
</p>

<p>"How do you feel?" the technician asked.
</p>

<p>"Weathered. I feel properly weathered."
</p>

<p>K. lived with intense weather. The storms mattered again. The sunshine felt significant.
</p>

<p>The restoration had worked. His climate was as powerful as it had ever been.
</p>

<p>But the knowledge of deterioration remained. His weather had weakened once. It would weaken again.
</p>

<p>Restoration was not cure. It was maintenance.
</p>

<p>The weather would fade again, and he would return for restoration again, in an endless cycle of degradation and repair.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>World 297</h2>

<p>The illumination was changing, and K. was experiencing different light, and the light authority was explaining that visual conditions were being adjusted.
</p>

<p>"Your personal illumination has been modified," the officer said. "You'll see things differently now."
</p>

<p>K. felt the change—the light around him shifting, the visual world altering in ways he couldn't quite identify.
</p>

<p>"What's different?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"Spectrum adjustments. You're receiving different wavelengths. The world will look different because the light is different."
</p>

<p>K. looked at the world. It did look different—colors slightly shifted, shadows slightly altered, the familiar made strange by modified illumination.
</p>

<p>"Is this better?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"Better for what purpose? The adjustment serves specific functions. Whether you prefer it is not the criterion."
</p>

<p>K. lived with adjusted light. He saw a different world now—the same objects, the same people, but lit differently, colored differently.
</p>

<p>He adapted. He had no choice.
</p>

<p>But he remembered the old light. He remembered how things had looked before.
</p>

<p>The new light was reality now. The old light was memory, fading, becoming harder to recall.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>World 298</h2>

<p>The normalization was for everything, and K. was being comprehensively standardized, and the process would make him completely average.
</p>

<p>"This is the final normalization," the normalizer said. "When we're done, you'll be indistinguishable from the mean."
</p>

<p>K. felt the comprehensive normalization—every aspect of himself being adjusted, calibrated, averaged.
</p>

<p>"What will I be?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"You'll be normal. Completely normal. Nothing distinctive. Nothing remarkable."
</p>

<p>K. emerged from the final normalization. He was average in every dimension—physical, emotional, cognitive, spiritual.
</p>

<p>"How do you feel?" the normalizer asked.
</p>

<p>"Normal. I feel normal."
</p>

<p>K. lived as a completely normal person. He had no distinctive features. He attracted no special attention.
</p>

<p>He was interchangeable with millions of others—a standard unit, a baseline human, a person without particularity.
</p>

<p>The normalization was complete. The individual was gone.
</p>

<p>What remained was normal. What remained was everyone.
</p>

<p>What remained was no one in particular.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>World 299</h2>

<p>The weights were normalizing, and K. was becoming average mass, and the process was bringing him to the universal mean.
</p>

<p>"Your weight is approaching the universal average," the officer said. "A few more adjustments and you'll be exactly median."
</p>

<p>K. felt himself becoming average. His mass was adjusting, losing its particularity, becoming what everyone weighed.
</p>

<p>"Is average good?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"Average is neutral. Average is the baseline. Average is what exists when nothing distinguishes."
</p>

<p>K. emerged at exactly average weight. He weighed precisely what everyone weighed—not heavy, not light, just the exact middle.
</p>

<p>"How do you feel?" the officer asked.
</p>

<p>"Average. I feel exactly average."
</p>

<p>K. lived at average weight. He took up the average amount of space. He exerted the average amount of gravitational force.
</p>

<p>Nothing about his mass was notable. Nothing about his presence was distinctive.
</p>

<p>He was the mean. He was the median. He was the center of the distribution.
</p>

<p>The edges were gone. The outliers were normalized.
</p>

<p>He was average, entirely.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>World 300</h2>

<p>The focus was on restoration, and K. was being repaired one final time, and the technician was explaining that this restoration would be permanent.
</p>

<p>"This is the last restoration," the technician said. "After this, your focus will be fixed. No more degradation."
</p>

<p>K. felt the permanent restoration—his attention being locked into place, stabilized, made unchangeable.
</p>

<p>"What does permanent mean?" K. asked.
</p>

<p>"Your focus will not degrade. It will also not improve. It will be exactly this level, forever."
</p>

<p>K. emerged with permanent focus. His attention was fixed—capable, functional, immutable.
</p>

<p>"How do you feel?" the technician asked.
</p>

<p>"Fixed. I feel fixed."
</p>

<p>K. lived with permanent focus. He could concentrate at exactly one level. Not more, not less.
</p>

<p>The degradation was gone. The variation was also gone.
</p>

<p>He was permanently focused. He was permanently unable to focus differently.
</p>

<p>The restoration had worked. The restoration had also ended possibility.
</p>

<p>His attention would never fail. His attention would never grow.
</p>

<p>He was fixed. He would remain fixed.
</p>

<p>Forever.
