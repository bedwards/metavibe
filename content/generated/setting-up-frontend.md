## Introduction

This guide covers frontend, database, containerization, ci-cd, authentication, testing, api-development, payments, deployment, typescript, code-quality, version-control, refactoring, debugging, feature-development, mobile, caching, database-migrations based on real-world vibe coding sessions. Vibe coding is an AI-assisted development approach where you describe what you want and let AI handle the implementation details.

## What We're Building

In this session, we modified 16 files to implement the feature. The key files involved:

- `folk-care-0/.secrets.txt`
- `workflows/backup.yml`
- `workflows/deploy.yml`
- `web/index.html`
- `pages/Login.tsx`

## Tools and Techniques

The following tools were used in this vibe coding session:

- **Read**: Reading and understanding existing code
- **Bash**: Running shell commands
- **TodoWrite**: Specialized development tool
- **Edit**: Making targeted changes to files
- **Grep**: Searching code content
- **BashOutput**: Specialized development tool
- **KillShell**: Specialized development tool
- **Glob**: Finding files by pattern
- **Write**: Creating new files

## Key Patterns

When working with frontend, several patterns emerged:

1. **Start with the end in mind** - Describe the desired outcome clearly
2. **Iterate quickly** - Make small changes and verify frequently
3. **Trust but verify** - Use screenshots and tests to confirm behavior

## Session Summary

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:

## Conclusion

Vibe coding transforms how we approach frontend and database and containerization and ci-cd and authentication and testing and api-development and payments and deployment and typescript and code-quality and version-control and refactoring and debugging and feature-development and mobile and caching and database-migrations. By focusing on outcomes rather than syntax, we can build faster and with fewer errors.

The session ran from 12/3/2025 and involved 452 interactions.
