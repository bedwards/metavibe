# Introduction

Every vibe coding session is a lesson in disguise.

When you spend an afternoon building Stripe integration with Claude, you're not just shipping a feature—you're learning patterns that apply to payment systems everywhere. When you debug a gnarly database migration, you're accumulating knowledge about schema evolution that others would pay to learn.

The problem is that this knowledge evaporates. The session ends, you move on, and the insights stay locked in a chat log that nobody will ever read again.

This book is about capturing that knowledge and transforming it into something durable: how-to guides that help others build similar systems.

## Why Write How-to Content?

Three reasons:

**1. Solidify your own understanding.** Writing forces clarity. When you explain how to integrate Stripe, you discover gaps in your own mental model. The act of teaching is the act of learning.

**2. Build reputation and reach.** Technical content that helps people solve real problems gets shared. It establishes you as someone who knows what they're talking about. It opens doors.

**3. Create passive income streams.** A well-crafted how-to book on a valuable topic can generate revenue for years. Platforms like Gumroad and Kobo make distribution trivial.

## Why Use AI to Write It?

Because the bottleneck isn't knowledge—it's time.

You already have the expertise from your coding sessions. What you don't have is hours to sit down and write polished prose. AI changes that equation:

- **First drafts in minutes, not days.** Describe what you want to cover, and AI produces a starting point.
- **Session logs as source material.** Your vibe coding conversations contain the raw material—AI can extract and generalize it.
- **Iteration without burnout.** Refining a draft with AI feels like collaboration, not labor.

This isn't about replacing human judgment. You still decide what's worth writing about, what structure makes sense, and whether the output is accurate. AI handles the mechanical work of putting words on the page.

## What This Book Covers

We'll walk through the entire pipeline:

1. **Capturing** knowledge from coding sessions
2. **Structuring** content as books, essays, and tutorials
3. **Writing** with AI assistance while maintaining quality
4. **Publishing** to GitHub Pages, Gumroad, and Kobo
5. **Automating** the pipeline so content flows continuously

By the end, you'll have a system that transforms your everyday vibe coding into a library of how-to guides.

## How to Read This Book

Each chapter builds on the previous one, but they're also designed to stand alone. If you're already capturing sessions and just want to know about publishing, skip ahead.

The code examples assume you're working with TypeScript and Node.js, but the principles apply to any language. The AI prompting strategies work with Claude, GPT-4, or any capable model.

Let's get started.
