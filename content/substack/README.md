## Writing Style Guide

Based on first principles, not jargon:

1. **Start with why** - What problem does this solve for readers?
2. **Build from fundamentals** - Explain concepts from basics up
3. **Differentiate clearly** - How is this different from similar concepts?
4. **Show, don't tell** - Use concrete examples over abstract claims
5. **Be opinionated** - Take a position and defend it with evidence
6. **Earn your length** - Every paragraph should add value

## Aesthetic

- Not corporate (no buzzwords, no "leverage synergies")
- Not tech bro (no "crushing it", no hustle culture)
- Clear, thoughtful, substantive
- Accessible to intelligent non-experts
- Respects the reader's time and intelligence
