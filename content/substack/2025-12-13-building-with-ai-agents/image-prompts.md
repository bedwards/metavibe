## Header Image

A quiet study at golden hour, late afternoon light streaming through a window onto a cluttered but organized desk. A developer's workspace but warm and lived-in—coffee cup casting a long shadow, a few books stacked to the side, a laptop open with code barely visible. The mood is contemplative, not busy. No stock photo energy. Think Edward Hopper meets a home office. Slightly desaturated colors, editorial photography style, film grain.

## Section Break Image

An abstract representation of context and memory: a series of overlapping transparent sheets, each containing fragments of handwritten notes and diagrams, layered so you can see through to layers below but the deepest layers are nearly illegible. Soft natural light from above. The sheets should feel like paper, not digital. Warm cream and soft amber tones. Inspired by Dieter Rams minimalism but organic, not cold. Medium format photography aesthetic.

## Closing Image

Two hands—one human, one subtly artificial (perhaps with visible wire-frame or circuitry pattern under translucent skin)—working together to stack small wooden blocks into a structure. The structure is incomplete but clearly progressing. Soft focus background, sharp focus on the hands and blocks. The lighting is natural, diffused, like an overcast day through a large window. The mood is collaborative, not dystopian. Think of a documentary photograph, unstaged, honest. Muted earth tones with one warm highlight.
